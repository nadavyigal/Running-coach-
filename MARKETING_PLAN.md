## 14. FLEXIBLE MONETIZATION STRATEGY

Given your interest in "a mix of all the above" approaches, here's a flexible monetization path:

### Option A: Freemium from Day 1
**Approach:** Launch with free tier + premium ($4.99/month)
- **Pros:** Tests willingness to pay immediately, establishes value perception, early revenue
- **Cons:** May reduce initial user acquisition, requires polished premium features
- **Best if:** You're confident in product quality and want to validate pricing early

### Option B: Free Launch → Premium at 30 Days
**Approach:** Everyone gets full features free for 30 days, then introduce premium
- **Pros:** Maximizes user acquisition, builds habit before paywall, creates urgency
- **Cons:** Users might churn when paywall appears, revenue delayed
- **Best if:** You want to prioritize growth and user feedback first

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended for Bootstrap)
**Approach:** Launch with generous free tier, introduce premium gradually
- **Month 1:** 100% free access, focus on product-market fit
- **Month 2:** Announce premium coming soon (grandfathered pricing for early adopters)
- **Month 3:** Launch premium with early bird discount ($3.99 → $4.99)
- **Pros:** Balances growth with monetization, rewards early adopters, tests pricing
- **Cons:** Requires patience, more complex messaging

### Recommended Free vs. Premium Split

**Free Tier (Forever):**
- AI-generated training plan (basic)
- GPS run tracking with manual entry
- AI coach chat (5 messages/day limit)

- Custom plan builder and adjustments
- Export to other platforms (Strava, Garmin Connect)
- Advanced analytics dashboard

### Early Adopter Strategy
- First 100 users: Lifetime premium free (grandfathered)
