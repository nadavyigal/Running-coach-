```

## 🎯 How to Use Elite Agents with Claude Code - Step by Step

### How It Works Behind the Scenes

When you install the agents in `~/.claude/agents/`, Claude Code automatically:
1. **Scans** the agents directory for all `.md` files
2. **Reads** the YAML frontmatter (name, description, model)
3. **Loads** agent instructions when relevant to your request
4. **Activates** the right specialists based on your task

### Step 1: Install the Agents
```bash
cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/lorenzodetomasi/elite-claude-agents.git agents
```

This creates the structure:
```
~/.claude/
└── agents/
    ├── react-wizard.md
    ├── aws-architect.md
    ├── kubernetes-pilot.md
    └── ... (97 more agents)
```

### Step 2: Start Claude Code
```bash
claude code
```

### Step 3: Use Agents in Your Conversations

Claude automatically detects which agents to use based on your request:

**Example 1: Building a React App**
```
You: I need to build a modern e-commerce site with React

Claude: I'll assemble the right team for your e-commerce project:
- react-wizard will handle the frontend architecture
- nextjs-architect will set up SSR for SEO
- stripe-specialist will implement payments
- aws-architect will design the infrastructure

Let's start with the React components...
```

**Example 2: Fixing Performance Issues**
```
You: My Node.js API is slow and timing out

Claude: I'll activate performance-optimizer to diagnose this.
[Analyzes code, identifies bottlenecks]
- Found N+1 query problem in /api/products
- Missing database indexes on user_id
- No caching layer implemented

Let me fix these issues...
```

**Example 3: Security Audit**
```
You: Can you review my authentication system for vulnerabilities?

Claude: I'll use threat-modeler and penetration-tester for this security audit.
[Performs comprehensive security analysis]
- Found JWT tokens without expiration
- Missing rate limiting on login endpoint
- Passwords stored with weak hashing

Here's how to fix each vulnerability...
```

### 💡 Pro Tips for Maximum Productivity

1. **Be Specific About Your Needs**
   ```
   ❌ "Help me with React"
   ✅ "Build a React dashboard with real-time data updates using WebSockets"
   ```

2. **Request Multiple Agents**
   ```
   "I need to build a secure payment system"
   Claude automatically activates: stripe-specialist + security-architect + nodejs-expert
   ```

3. **Use Agents for Code Review**
   ```
   "Review this Kubernetes config for production best practices"
   Claude uses: kubernetes-pilot + security-architect + reliability-engineer
   ```

4. **Combine Agents for Complex Tasks**
   ```
   "Migrate my monolith to microservices on AWS"
   Claude assembles: aws-architect + kubernetes-pilot + docker-captain + migration-expert
   ```

### 🔥 Real Session Example

```bash
$ claude code

You: I want to build a real-time collaborative editor like Google Docs

Claude: I'll assemble a specialized team for building a real-time collaborative editor:

🎯 **Activating agents:** (from ~/.claude/agents/)
- react-wizard (frontend architecture)
- websocket-expert (real-time sync)  
- nodejs-expert (backend server)
- mongodb-master (document storage)
- redis-specialist (session management)

Let's start with the architecture. Here's what we'll build:

1. **Frontend (React + WebSockets)**
   [Creates collaborative editor component with live cursors]

2. **Backend (Node.js + Socket.io)**
   [Implements operational transformation for conflict resolution]

3. **Database Layer**
   [Sets up MongoDB for documents, Redis for presence]

4. **Real-time Sync Engine**
   [Builds CRDT-based synchronization]

[Continues building the entire system with production-ready code...]
```
