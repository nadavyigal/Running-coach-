# GPS Diagnostic Guide

When users are struggling to make progress, use this guide to identify the breakdown point and provide targeted solutions.

## Diagnostic Framework

Run through these three diagnostic questions in order:

### 1. Goal Diagnosis

**Primary Question**: Is the goal clear and compelling?

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- Can you state your goal in one specific sentence?
- If I asked you tomorrow what your goal is, would you say the exact same thing?
- Is your goal measurable? How will you know when you've achieved it?
- Why does this goal matter to you personally (not should matter, but does matter)?
- What would achieving this goal change in your life?
- Are there things you're not willing to sacrifice for this goal?

**Red Flags**:
- Vague or abstract language ("get better at X", "start a business")
- Goals driven by "should" or external pressure
- Can't articulate why it matters personally
- No clear success criteria
- Unrealistic timeline or scope

**Solutions**:
- Rework goal to be specific and measurable
- Explore deeper motivations through "5 whys" technique
- Add quantifiable metrics
- Define anti-goals to clarify boundaries
- Break massive goals into smaller milestones

### 2. Plan Diagnosis

**Primary Question**: Do you believe the plan will work and that you'll actually do it?

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- What are your 3-5 major actions to achieve this goal?
- On a scale of 0-100%, how confident are you these actions will produce the result? (Theory)
- On a scale of 0-100%, how confident are you that you'll actually do these actions? (Practice)
- Have you thought about what might stop you?
- What's your biggest concern about this plan?
- Have others achieved similar goals with this approach?

**Red Flags**:
- Confidence below 80% on either theory or practice
- Too many action items (>5 major moves)
- Actions are vague or unclear
- No consideration of obstacles
- Plan relies on perfect conditions
- Actions don't clearly lead to goal

**Solutions**:
- Reduce to 3-5 most impactful actions
- Research proven approaches for this type of goal
- Run Crystal Ball Method to identify failure points
- Create mitigation strategies for top 3 obstacles
- Simplify the plan to increase likelihood of execution
- Test one major move for 2 weeks before committing to full plan

### 3. System Diagnosis

**Primary Question**: Are you actually executing the plan daily/weekly?

**Tracking Questions**:
- How are you measuring your progress?
- Can you show me your tracking system right now?
- When's the last time you checked your progress?
- What are your current numbers?

**Reminder Questions**:
- How do you remember to work on your goal?
- What triggers or cues remind you?
- Where/when do you see your goal written down?
- Do you have scheduled time blocks for your major moves?

**Accountability Questions**:
- Who knows about your goal?
- Who checks in with you about progress?
- How often do you review progress with someone else?
- What happens if you don't follow through?

**Red Flags**:
- Not tracking anything
- No regular measurement or check-ins
- Can't recall last time they worked on goal
- No external accountability
- No scheduled time for major moves
- Goal only exists "in their head"
- Relying solely on willpower

**Solutions**:

**For Tracking Issues**:
- Set up dead-simple tracking system (Google Sheet, app, journal)
- Schedule weekly review time
- Make metrics visible (dashboard, graph, scoreboard)
- Track leading indicators (actions) not just lagging (results)

**For Reminder Issues**:
- Write goal down daily (morning pages)
- Create visual cue in environment
- Set phone reminders at key times
- Schedule non-negotiable calendar blocks
- Use habit stacking (attach to existing routine)

**For Accountability Issues**:
- Find accountability buddy (weekly check-ins)
- Join relevant community or mastermind group
- Hire coach or mentor
- Make public commitment
- Create stakes (bet, donation if you fail)
- Use apps like Beeminder or StickK

## Common Breakdown Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Vague Dreamer
**Symptoms**: Exciting goal but no specifics, changes direction frequently
**Broken Component**: Goal
**Solution**: Force specificity. Make them commit to exact numbers, dates, and metrics.

### Pattern 2: The Overwhelmed Planner
**Symptoms**: Detailed plan with 15+ action items, analysis paralysis
**Broken Component**: Plan
**Solution**: Reduce to top 3-5 actions. Use 80/20 rule. Start with easiest win.

### Pattern 3: The Motivated but Inconsistent
**Symptoms**: Great start, drops off after 2 weeks, relies on motivation
**Broken Component**: System
**Solution**: Build tracking and accountability. Make it impossible to forget.

### Pattern 4: The Perfectionist
**Symptoms**: Won't start until conditions are perfect, endless preparation
**Broken Component**: Plan (overthinking) + System (not executing)
**Solution**: Time-box planning. Force imperfect action. "Done is better than perfect."

### Pattern 5: The Lone Wolf
**Symptoms**: Tries to do everything alone, won't ask for help
**Broken Component**: System (accountability)
**Solution**: Mandate external accountability. Make it non-negotiable.

## Conversation Starters by Diagnosis

**When Goal is Broken**:
"I notice your goal is a bit abstract right now. Let's make it more concrete. Instead of 'get fit,' what specific number are we trying to hit? What would success look like in measurable terms?"

**When Plan is Broken**:
"Your plan has 12 different things to do. That's going to be overwhelming. If you could only do 3 things that would get you 80% of the results, what would they be?"

**When System is Broken**:
"You have a great goal and solid plan, but I don't see a system to make sure you actually do it. How are you going to track this? Who's going to call you out if you don't follow through?"

## Recovery Protocols

### When They Want to Give Up

1. **Acknowledge the struggle**: "It sounds like this has been really frustrating."
2. **Run diagnostic**: "Let's figure out exactly where things broke down."
3. **Identify the fix**: "Here's the specific thing we need to change."
4. **Simplify**: "Let's make this easier for the next 2 weeks."
5. **Reset**: "We're not starting over, we're adjusting the approach."

### When They're Inconsistent

1. **Diagnose the gap**: "What's different between the days you follow through and the days you don't?"
2. **Remove friction**: "How can we make the right action the easiest action?"
3. **Add structure**: "Let's schedule exact times and set up automatic reminders."
4. **Build accountability**: "Who can we bring in to help keep you on track?"

### When Results are Slow

1. **Check tracking**: "Are you measuring the right things?"
2. **Examine actions**: "Are you actually doing the major moves consistently?"
3. **Reassess timeline**: "Is your timeline realistic based on similar examples?"
4. **Adjust expectations**: "Progress isn't always linear. Let's look at the trend."
5. **Celebrate small wins**: "What progress have you made, even if it's small?"
