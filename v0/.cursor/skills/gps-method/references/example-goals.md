# GPS Method Example Goals

Complete GPS breakdowns across different domains to demonstrate quality and structure.

## Example 1: Learning Goal - Master TypeScript

### Goal (The Destination)

**Specific Target**: 
Complete 3 production-ready TypeScript projects and pass the TypeScript Advanced Certification by September 1, 2025.

**Why This Matters**: 
I want to become the go-to developer on my team for type-safe architecture. This will make me more valuable, increase my confidence in code reviews, and position me for the senior engineer promotion.

**Anti-Goals**: 
- Not spending money on courses (budget constraint)
- Not staying up late learning (need 8 hours sleep)
- Not learning in isolation without building real projects
- Not just following tutorials without understanding concepts

### Plan (The Roadmap)

**Major Moves**:
1. Complete TypeScript Deep Dive book (1 chapter per week, 12 weeks)
2. Build project 1: CLI tool for team (refactor existing JS tool)
3. Build project 2: Type-safe API client library
4. Build project 3: Full-stack app with strict TypeScript
5. Take practice certification exams until scoring 90%+

**Confidence Assessment**:
- Theory (will these actions produce the result?): 85%
- Practice (will I actually do these actions?): 80%

**Failure Forecast**:

1. **Potential Obstacle**: Get stuck on complex concepts and give up
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Join TypeScript Discord community, schedule office hours with senior dev Alex every 2 weeks, allow 2 hours per concept to struggle before asking for help

2. **Potential Obstacle**: Projects take too long, run out of time
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Time-box each project to 3 weeks max, keep MVPs small, ship ugly code that works first, polish later

3. **Potential Obstacle**: Work projects take priority, learning gets pushed aside
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Block 6-8am Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday as non-negotiable learning time, get manager's buy-in that TypeScript skills help team

### System (The Execution)

**Tracking**: 
- Notion tracker: chapters completed, project milestones, practice exam scores
- GitHub contributions (projects must be committed)
- Weekly journal entry: what I learned, what I struggled with

**Reminders**: 
- Calendar blocks: Tues/Thurs/Sat 6-8am "TypeScript Learning"
- Alarm at 5:45am on learning days
- Weekly goals written on whiteboard in home office
- Phone reminder Sunday 8pm: "Plan next week's learning"

**Accountability**: 
- Bi-weekly check-ins with Alex (senior dev)
- Monthly demo to team of what I built
- TypeScript Discord accountability channel (daily check-ins)
- Shared Notion page with girlfriend showing progress

## Example 2: Relationship Goal - Strengthen Marriage

### Goal (The Destination)

**Specific Target**: 
Improve marriage satisfaction score (shared survey) from 6/10 to 8/10 by December 31, 2025, with weekly date nights and resolved recurring conflicts.

**Why This Matters**: 
We've been coasting and I want to actively invest in our relationship before problems get worse. I want us to feel connected and excited about our future together. This is the most important relationship in my life.

**Anti-Goals**: 
- Not spending money we don't have on expensive dates
- Not forcing artificial romance that feels inauthentic
- Not ignoring real problems with superficial fixes
- Not making partner do all the emotional work

### Plan (The Roadmap)

**Major Moves**:
1. Weekly date nights (every Friday, planned alternating weeks)
2. Daily 15-minute connection time (no phones, actual conversation)
3. Read and discuss one relationship book together (5-Year Marriage book)
4. Complete couples communication workshop by March
5. Monthly "state of us" check-in conversations

**Confidence Assessment**:
- Theory (will these actions produce the result?): 90%
- Practice (will I actually do these actions?): 70%

**Failure Forecast**:

1. **Potential Obstacle**: Work deadlines and tiredness derail date nights
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Pre-schedule all dates 3 months in advance, calendar invites to both, backup activity if we're too tired (movie at home counts), no canceling unless emergency

2. **Potential Obstacle**: Daily connection time feels forced or awkward
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Use conversation starter cards, keep it light at first, focus on appreciation and curiosity, it's okay if some days are just 15 minutes of presence

3. **Potential Obstacle**: Difficult conversations avoided because they're uncomfortable
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Use "state of us" structure, practice from workshop, remember: short-term discomfort leads to long-term connection

### System (The Execution)

**Tracking**: 
- Shared Google Calendar with date nights marked
- Monthly satisfaction survey (1-10 scale on 5 dimensions)
- Journal tracking: date activities tried, quality time hours per week
- Check-in notes from "state of us" conversations

**Reminders**: 
- Friday 3pm reminder: "Confirm date night tonight"
- Daily 8pm alarm: "15-minute connection time"
- First of month reminder: "Schedule this month's dates"
- Vision board in bedroom with relationship goals

**Accountability**: 
- Couples therapist monthly check-ins
- Trusted friend couple mentors (quarterly dinners)
- Weekly text exchange with partner confirming date plan
- Annual marriage retreat scheduled

## Example 3: Creative Goal - Launch a Podcast

### Goal (The Destination)

**Specific Target**: 
Launch a weekly podcast about indie software development, publish 26 episodes by June 30, 2025, and reach 1,000 downloads per episode.

**Why This Matters**: 
I have tons of knowledge from 10 years building software that I want to share. I love the medium of podcasting and want to build an audience of fellow indie developers. This could lead to consulting opportunities and would be creatively fulfilling.

**Anti-Goals**: 
- Not spending more than $500 on equipment initially
- Not aiming for perfection that prevents launching
- Not copying other podcasts' style (want authentic voice)
- Not interviewing people just for clout

### Plan (The Roadmap)

**Major Moves**:
1. Record and publish first 5 solo episodes (Jan 1-31)
2. Launch with 3 episodes live (Feb 1)
3. Publish weekly episodes every Tuesday (26 total)
4. Promote on Twitter, Reddit, Indie Hackers
5. Get 5 guest interviews from devs I respect

**Confidence Assessment**:
- Theory (will these actions produce the result?): 75%
- Practice (will I actually do these actions?): 85%

**Failure Forecast**:

1. **Potential Obstacle**: Audio quality is bad, feels unprofessional
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Buy decent mic ($120), learn basic editing in 2 weeks, first 3 episodes are learning experiences, good enough beats perfect

2. **Potential Obstacle**: Can't get to 1,000 downloads without audience
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Start building email list 2 months before launch, engage in communities first, collaborate with other podcasters, focus on value not vanity metrics

3. **Potential Obstacle**: Run out of content ideas or motivation
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Batch record 3 episodes at a time, create backlog of 20 topic ideas before launch, repurpose Twitter threads into episodes, interview guests when solo content is hard

### System (The Execution)

**Tracking**: 
- Podcast hosting analytics (downloads, completion rate)
- Spreadsheet: episode topics, publish dates, download numbers
- Social media engagement metrics
- Email subscriber count

**Reminders**: 
- Sunday 2pm: Record this week's episode
- Monday 5pm: Edit and upload
- Tuesday 9am: Publish and promote
- Monthly review: What's working, what's not

**Accountability**: 
- Mastermind group of content creators (weekly calls)
- Public commitment on Twitter
- Pre-scheduled all 26 publish dates
- Podcast buddy for accountability (also launching)

## Example 4: Financial Goal - Save Emergency Fund

### Goal (The Destination)

**Specific Target**: 
Save $12,000 emergency fund (6 months of expenses) by December 31, 2025, in a high-yield savings account, separate from checking.

**Why This Matters**: 
Living paycheck to paycheck creates constant anxiety. I want financial security to handle unexpected car repairs, medical bills, or job loss without panic. This is about peace of mind and adult responsibility.

**Anti-Goals**: 
- Not cutting everything that brings joy (still want coffee/entertainment)
- Not raiding the fund for non-emergencies
- Not putting myself in risky investment schemes
- Not neglecting current bills to save

### Plan (The Roadmap)

**Major Moves**:
1. Save $1,000 per month automatically ($500 per paycheck)
2. Reduce discretionary spending by $300/month (dining out, subscriptions)
3. Sell unused items for extra $500 total
4. Pick up freelance work for extra $200/month
5. Cancel/reduce 5 subscriptions ($100/month saved)

**Confidence Assessment**:
- Theory (will these actions produce the result?): 95%
- Practice (will I actually do these actions?): 75%

**Failure Forecast**:

1. **Potential Obstacle**: Unexpected expenses eat into savings progress
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Start with $500/month if $1,000 feels too tight, have $1,000 buffer in checking first, track expenses to catch leaks

2. **Potential Obstacle**: Temptation to use emergency fund for wants
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Keep fund in separate bank (out of sight), define "emergency" clearly in writing, 48-hour rule before any withdrawal

3. **Potential Obstacle**: Lifestyle creep when I get a raise
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Any raise = 80% goes to savings increase, lock in current lifestyle, automate increased savings immediately

### System (The Execution)

**Tracking**: 
- Ally Bank high-yield savings account (track balance)
- Spreadsheet: monthly deposits, current total, projected completion date
- YNAB budget app (track spending in all categories)
- Monthly net worth snapshot

**Reminders**: 
- Automatic transfer: $500 each paycheck (1st and 15th)
- Weekly Sunday budget review
- Phone wallpaper: "$12,000 by Dec 31"
- Monthly expense audit (1st of month)

**Accountability**: 
- Weekly check-in with spouse on spending
- Quarterly money date to review progress
- Financial advisor meeting every 6 months
- Friend accountability group (monthly sharing)
