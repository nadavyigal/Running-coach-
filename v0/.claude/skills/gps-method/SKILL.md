description: Evidence-based goal achievement framework using Goal, Plan, and System methodology. Use when users want to set goals, create actionable plans, build execution systems, or diagnose why they're struggling to make progress on existing goals. Triggers include requests to "set a goal", "help me achieve", "create a plan", "why am I not making progress", or similar goal-setting and achievement queries.

# GPS Method - Goal Achievement Framework

An evidence-based framework for achieving any goal through systematic breakdown and execution. GPS stands for **Goal, Plan, and System**.

## How This Works

The GPS method serves two purposes:

1. **Goal Creation**: Guide users through defining clear goals and building actionable systems to achieve them
2. **Progress Diagnosis**: When users struggle, identify exactly where the breakdown is occurring

## Workflow Overview

Guide users through this sequence:

### Mode 1: Creating a New Goal

1. **Define the Goal** - Establish destination with specificity, motivation, and constraints
2. **Build the Plan** - Identify major moves, assess feasibility, and forecast obstacles
3. **Design the System** - Set up tracking, reminders, and accountability mechanisms
4. **Document Everything** - Create a structured goal document for reference

### Mode 2: Diagnosing Existing Goals

When a user is struggling with progress:

1. **Identify which component is broken** (Goal, Plan, or System)
2. **Ask diagnostic questions** specific to that component
3. **Recommend targeted fixes** based on the diagnosis

## Creating a New Goal

### Step 1: Define the Goal (The Destination)

Guide the user through three factors:

**Specificity and Concreteness**

- Avoid vague goals like "start a business" or "get fit"
- Ask: "Can you make this more specific and measurable?"
- Push for quantifiable outcomes: "reduce visceral fat by 50%" or "build a business making $100k/year"

**Emotional Compulsion (The Why)**

- Explore intrinsic motivations
- Ask: "Why does this matter to you personally?"
- Watch for "should" goals driven by external pressure (fame, status, obligation)
- Help distinguish between genuine desire and external expectations

**Anti-Goals (Constraints)**

- Identify what they want to avoid while pursuing the goal
- Ask: "What would you NOT be willing to sacrifice for this?"
- Examples: "not working weekends", "not sacrificing family time", "not going into debt"

### Step 2: Build the Plan (The Roadmap)

Guide the user through three components:

**Major Moves (3-5 Primary Actions)**

- Ask: "What are the 3-5 main things you need to do to achieve this?"
- Push for concrete, actionable steps
- Example for weight loss: specific calorie targets, protein intake, number of weekly workouts
- Example for business: revenue target, customer acquisition strategy, product timeline

**Realistic Assessment**

- Test if the plan works in theory: "Will these actions actually produce the result?"
- Test if the plan works in practice: "Are you actually likely to follow through?"
- Use 80% confidence threshold: if below 80% on either, rethink the plan
- Ask directly: "On a scale of 0-100%, how confident are you this will work?"

**Crystal Ball Method (Mental Forecasting)**

- Have them imagine they failed in 6 months
- Ask: "What are the top 3 reasons this didn't work out?"
- For each failure reason, create a preemptive strategy
- This builds in resilience before obstacles arise

### Step 3: Design the System (The Execution)

Guide the user through three mechanisms:

**Tracking**

- Ask: "How will you monitor progress?"
- Suggest specific tools: Google Sheet, app, scale, journal
- Explain: awareness of numbers nudges better micro-decisions
- Make it as frictionless as possible

**Reminders**

- Ask: "How will you remember to work on this daily?"
- Suggest options:
  - Write goals down each morning
  - Vision board in visible location
  - Calendar blocks for major moves
  - Phone reminders at key times
- The brain forgets resolutions without cues

**Accountability**

- Ask: "Who can help hold you accountable?"
- Options: accountability buddy, squad, mentor, coach, public commitment
- Most people struggle with self-accountability alone
- External pressure and support are critical when motivation wanes

## Documenting the Goal

Create a structured document using this template (see `references/goal-template.md` for full version):

```markdown
# [Goal Name]

## Goal (The Destination)

**Specific Target**: [Quantifiable outcome]
**Why This Matters**: [Intrinsic motivation]
**Anti-Goals**: [What you won't sacrifice]

## Plan (The Roadmap)

**Major Moves**:

1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]

**Confidence Assessment**:

- Theory (will it work?): [X]%
- Practice (will I do it?): [X]%

**Failure Forecast**:

- Potential obstacle 1 → Mitigation strategy
- Potential obstacle 2 → Mitigation strategy
- Potential obstacle 3 → Mitigation strategy

## System (The Execution)

**Tracking**: [How you'll measure]
**Reminders**: [How you'll remember]
**Accountability**: [Who will help]
```

## Diagnosing Existing Goals

When a user is struggling, run through this diagnostic:

**Question 1: Is the Goal clear?**

- Can they articulate it in one specific sentence?
- If not → Work on Goal definition first

**Question 2: Do they believe the Plan will work?**

- Are they confident in the major moves (theory)?
- Are they confident they'll actually do them (practice)?
- If not → Revise the Plan

**Question 3: Are they executing the System?**

- Are they tracking?
- Are they using reminders?
- Do they have accountability?
- If not → Strengthen the System

See `references/diagnostic-guide.md` for detailed troubleshooting questions.

## The GPS Analogy

Help users understand through the literal GPS metaphor:

- **Goal** = Destination you type into the GPS
- **Plan** = Specific route chosen (highways vs. side streets)
- **System** = Dashboard and steering wheel that keep you on the road and monitor fuel

Without all three, you can't reliably reach your destination.
