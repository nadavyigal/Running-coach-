# Reduce Body Fat by 15% in 6 Months

## Goal (The Destination)

**Specific Target**: 
Reduce body fat percentage from 28% to 24% (15% reduction) by June 30, 2025, measured via DEXA scan.

**Why This Matters**: 
I want to feel energized playing with my kids without getting winded, and I want to reduce my risk of type 2 diabetes that runs in my family. This is about longevity and being present for my family.

**Anti-Goals**: 
- Not developing an unhealthy relationship with food or exercise
- Not spending more than 5 hours per week on workouts
- Not eliminating social meals or family dinners
- Not using extreme or unsustainable diet methods

## Plan (The Roadmap)

**Major Moves**:
1. Maintain 500-calorie daily deficit (target 1,800 calories/day)
2. Hit 150g protein daily
3. Strength train 3x per week (45 minutes each)
4. Walk 10,000 steps daily
5. Sleep 7-8 hours per night

**Confidence Assessment**:
- Theory (will these actions produce the result?): 90%
- Practice (will I actually do these actions?): 75%

**Failure Forecast** (Crystal Ball Method):

1. **Potential Obstacle**: Work stress leads to late-night snacking and skipping workouts
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Prep healthy snacks on Sundays, schedule workouts as non-negotiable calendar blocks at 6am before work starts

2. **Potential Obstacle**: Social events and dinners derail calorie targets
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Bank 200 calories on surrounding days when social events are planned, focus on protein-rich options at events

3. **Potential Obstacle**: Motivation drops after initial 2-3 weeks
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Join accountability group, schedule monthly DEXA scans to track progress objectively, reward myself with non-food treats at milestones

## System (The Execution)

**Tracking**: 
- MyFitnessPal app for daily food logging
- Apple Watch for step counting
- Weekly weigh-ins every Saturday morning
- Monthly DEXA scans (scheduled all 6 dates in advance)

**Reminders**: 
- Phone alarm at 9pm: "Plan tomorrow's meals"
- Phone alarm at 5:45am: "Workout gear on"
- Workout clothes laid out night before
- Post-it on bathroom mirror: "24% by June 30"

**Accountability**: 
- Weekly check-in with fitness buddy Sarah (Sundays at 4pm)
- Monthly progress review with personal trainer
- Shared MyFitnessPal diary with accountability group

# Launch SaaS Product and Reach $10k MRR

## Goal (The Destination)

**Specific Target**: 
Launch a B2B SaaS product and reach $10,000 in monthly recurring revenue by December 31, 2025, with at least 50 paying customers.

**Why This Matters**: 
I want to build something that solves a real problem I experienced as a project manager, and I want to create location-independent income that allows me to work from anywhere. This is about creative fulfillment and lifestyle freedom.

**Anti-Goals**: 
- Not raising venture capital or giving up equity
- Not working more than 50 hours per week
- Not building features customers don't actually need
- Not neglecting my health or relationships

## Plan (The Roadmap)

**Major Moves**:
1. Validate problem with 50 customer interviews by March 1
2. Build MVP with 3 core features by May 1
3. Launch to first 10 beta customers by June 1
4. Acquire 50 paying customers by December 31
5. Establish content marketing engine (2 blog posts/week)

**Confidence Assessment**:
- Theory (will these actions produce the result?): 70%
- Practice (will I actually do these actions?): 85%

**Failure Forecast** (Crystal Ball Method):

1. **Potential Obstacle**: Building features nobody wants (build trap)
   **Mitigation Strategy**: No code written until 30 customer interviews completed. Every feature must have 3+ customer requests. Weekly customer calls throughout development.

2. **Potential Obstacle**: Analysis paralysis on tech stack and architecture
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Use familiar stack (Rails + React). Time-box decisions to 2 hours max. Ship ugly but functional code first.

3. **Potential Obstacle**: Marketing ineffective, can't acquire customers
   **Mitigation Strategy**: Start content marketing 3 months before launch. Build email list of 500+ interested people. Offer founding member discount for first 20 customers.

## System (The Execution)

**Tracking**: 
- Notion dashboard with weekly metrics: interviews completed, features shipped, revenue, active customers
- Stripe for MRR tracking
- Google Analytics for website traffic
- Customer feedback spreadsheet

**Reminders**: 
- Monday 9am: Review weekly goals
- Daily standup note to myself: "What's the ONE thing today?"
- Calendar blocks: Customer interviews (Tues/Thurs 2-5pm), Deep work (Mon/Wed/Fri 6-9am)
- End of week review every Friday at 4pm

**Accountability**: 
- Bi-weekly check-ins with entrepreneur mentor
- Monthly revenue updates shared with mastermind group
- Public building on Twitter (weekly progress updates)
- Quarterly goals review with spouse
