### SEGMENT 2: PROBLEM + STAKES (7-18s)

| Time | Voiceover | Visual | On-Screen Text | Edit Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|----------------|------------|
| **7-18s** | "Rigid plans create guilt, not consistency. You miss a day, feel behind, and the habit breaks." | **Split approach:**<br><br>**7-12s:** Optional minimal B-roll<br>- Person checking calendar (stressed)<br>- OR continue showing UI (rigid plan example)<br><br>**12-18s:** Focus on UI<br>- Static, rigid plan view<br>- Visual emphasis on "locked in" schedule | "Guilt kills habits" (appears at 10s) | **Pacing:** Pause after "not consistency."<br>**Music:** Slightly tense, low<br>**B-roll:** OPTIONAL, keep very brief (5s max)<br>**Transition:** Fade to UI at 12s<br>**Voiceover:** Empathetic, understanding tone<br>**Goal:** Establish the stakes clearly |

- Keep very brief—UI is the star
- Should feel relatable, not dramatized

**Rigid Plan UI (12-18s):**
- Calendar with all workouts "locked in"
- Visual cues: no flexibility, everything scheduled perfectly
- Feels overwhelming or unrealistic
- Could show sample "Week 1, Day 1" traditional plan
- Hold for 6 seconds

**Text Overlay Style:**

- "Guilt kills habits" is the key message
- Empathetic, not preachy

**Edit Notes:**
