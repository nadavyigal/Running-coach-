## Time-Coded Voiceover Script

### HOOK (0–7s)
> "If your running plan collapses the moment you miss a workout, this is for you."

**Pacing:** Measured, empathetic
**Emphasis:** "this is for you" (direct address)
**Note:** Open with relatability, not urgency

---

### PROBLEM + STAKES (7–18s)
> "Rigid plans create guilt, not consistency. You miss a day, feel behind, and the habit breaks."

**Pacing:** Pause after "not consistency."
**Emphasis:** "guilt, not consistency" (the contrast) and "habit breaks" (the consequence)
**Note:** Establish the emotional and practical stakes clearly

---

### POSITIONING (18–26s)
> "Run-Smart is your AI running coach that adapts to your life—so the plan fits you, not the other way around."

**Pacing:** Clear, confident
**Emphasis:** "adapts to your life" and "fits you, not the other way around"
**Note:** This is the core positioning—deliver with authority

---

### STEP 1 — GOAL SELECTION (26–38s)
> "Start by choosing your goal and experience level. Run-Smart builds a week you can actually follow."

**Pacing:** Instructional, clear
**Emphasis:** "you can actually follow"
**Note:** Emphasize practicality and realism

---

### STEP 2 — TODAY & CALENDAR (38–52s)
> "Open Today to see exactly what to do. Open the calendar to see what's coming—simple and clear."

**Pacing:** Even, methodical
**Emphasis:** "exactly what to do" and "simple and clear"
**Note:** Viewers are following along with UI—give them time to process

---

### STEP 3 — MAGIC MOMENT: ADAPTATION (52–72s)
> "Now the key part: if you miss a run or move a workout, Run-Smart adjusts automatically. No guilt. No 'start over.' Just a smart next step."

**Pacing:** Slow down slightly on "Now the key part:" then pause briefly. Deliver "No guilt. No 'start over.'" as distinct beats.
**Emphasis:** "adjusts automatically", "No guilt", "Just a smart next step"
**Note:** This is the longest segment and the core value proposition—give it space to breathe

---

### STEP 4 — COACHING + RECOVERY (72–86s)
> "You can ask the coach quick questions—like when to push or when to take it easy—and get practical guidance."

**Pacing:** Conversational, natural
**Emphasis:** "quick questions" and "practical guidance"
**Note:** Examples ("when to push or when to take it easy") should sound like real user concerns

---

### RESULT + CTA (86–95s)
> "If you want to see how this works for your goals, book a 15-minute walkthrough. Link in the description."

**Pacing:** Warm, invitational
**Emphasis:** "for your goals" (personalization) and "book a 15-minute walkthrough"
**Note:** End on a clear, actionable next step without being pushy

## Delivery Notes

### Overall Tone

- Emphasis on understanding, not selling
- Patient pacing that respects viewer intelligence

### Pacing Guidelines
- Average speaking rate: ~135-145 words per minute (slower than landing page)

## Optional B-Roll Moments

If you choose to add 1-2 quick lifestyle clips (keep minimal):

- **7-18s (Problem):** Quick 2s clip of someone checking calendar/looking stressed
- **18-26s (Positioning):** Quick 2s clip of someone running happily

**IMPORTANT:** B-roll should be subtle and brief—UI demo is the star. Maximum 5-10% of runtime.
