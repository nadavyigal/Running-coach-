## Delivery Notes

### Overall Tone
- Energetic but not frantic
- Relatable and conversational
- Direct and benefit-focused
- No fluff—every word counts

### Key Moments
1. **Hook (0-4s):** Must stop the scroll—deliver with slight frustration that transforms to relief
2. **Magic Moment (16-24s):** The "overnight" adaptation is key—emphasize the effortlessness
3. **CTA (24-30s):** Quick but clear invitation

### Pacing Guidelines
- Average speaking rate: ~160-170 words per minute (faster than landing page)
- Very tight—no dead air
- Punchy delivery matches fast visual cuts
- Captions are CRITICAL for social autoplay

### Technical Specs
- Record in a quiet environment
- Use a quality microphone
- Slightly more energetic delivery than landing page version
- Record 3-5 takes of the full script (it's short)
- Consider recording alternate CTA: "Link in bio to book a demo"

- "Plans break when life happens"

**Caption Style:**

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Instagram Reels

- First 3 seconds are critical for retention
- Use hashtags: #RunningTips #RunningCoach #AICoaching #RunningMotivation

### TikTok (same video can be reused)
- Hook text overlay: "POV: Your running plan actually works with your schedule"
- Trending sounds optional but keep original VO as primary
- Hashtags: #RunTok #RunningTips #FitnessApp #AICoach

### YouTube Shorts (same video)
- Title: "Running Plan That Adapts When You Miss a Workout"
