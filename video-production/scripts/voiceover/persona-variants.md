# Persona Variant Scripts

**Purpose:** Swap these intro and CTA segments into any of the three video formats to create persona-specific versions.

**How to Use:**
1. Choose your base video format (Landing Hero, Reel, or YouTube)
2. Replace the INTRO (first 5-10s) with the persona-specific intro
3. Keep the middle workflow demo UNCHANGED
4. Replace the FINAL CTA (last 6-10s) with the persona-specific CTA

**Result:** You can create up to 12 video variants (3 formats × 4 personas) from the same core footage.
