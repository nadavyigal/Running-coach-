## Recording Best Practices

1. **Record each moment separately** (6-12s clips)
2. **Pause before and after actions** (0.5-1s before tap, 1-2s after update)
3. **Keep movements slow and intentional**
4. **Record both 16:9 (desktop) and 9:16 (mobile)** if possible
5. **Turn off notifications and dev overlays**
6. **Use highest resolution available**
