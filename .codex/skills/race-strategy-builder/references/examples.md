# Examples

- **Half marathon:** Negative split pacing with gels every 35–40 minutes; contingency to slow 5–10s/km in heat.
- **5K:** Conservative start (first km at easy+15s) then settle to target; no fueling, only pre-race carb/hydration reminder.
- **Marathon with hills:** Pace adjustments on hills, extra gel after steep climb, hydration increase if temp >22°C.
