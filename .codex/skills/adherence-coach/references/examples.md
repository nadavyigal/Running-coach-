# Examples

- **One missed tempo:** Reshuffle to easy run, move tempo to later in week, message: \"Small reset—focus on consistency, not catch-up volume.\"
- **Multiple skips with fatigue:** Suggest rest + two short easy runs; emit `SafetyFlag: load_spike` if catch-up requested.
- **Back on track:** Provide positive reinforcement and a single focus cue for the week.
