## 🎓 Best Practices

### Content Creation
- **Write for humans first, SEO second** - Authenticity beats keyword stuffing
- **Use founder voice** - Personal story resonates more than corporate speak
- **Show, don't just tell** - Screenshots, demos, real examples
- **Be specific** - "Adapts overnight based on HRV" > "Smart training"

### Community Engagement
- **Give 10x more value than you take** - Help first, promote second
- **Be genuinely helpful** - Answer questions without mentioning the app
- **Celebrate others** - Retweet, share, comment on other runners' wins
- **Stay consistent** - Daily engagement > sporadic bursts

### Email Marketing
- **Personalize** - Use first name, reference their signup date/position
- **Tell stories** - Behind-the-scenes, founder journey, user success
- **Provide value** - Every email should teach or inspire, not just sell
- **Clear CTAs** - One primary action per email

### Conversion Optimization
- **Reduce friction** - Fewer form fields, faster signup
- **Build trust** - Social proof, guarantees, transparency
- **Create urgency** - Limited beta spots, early bird pricing
- **Test everything** - Headlines, CTAs, pricing, timing
