## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't:
❌ Spam communities with self-promotion
❌ Ignore beta tester feedback
❌ Obsess over vanity metrics (followers vs conversions)
❌ Try to do everything at once (focus on 2-3 channels)
❌ Forget to ask for testimonials
❌ Skip the email sequence setup
❌ Build features instead of talking to users

### Do:
✅ Provide value first, promote second
✅ Interview your first 50 users personally
✅ Track conversion funnels, not just traffic
✅ Pick Instagram + Twitter, master them first
✅ Collect testimonials from Day 1
✅ Automate email nurturing early
✅ Spend 50%+ time talking to users

## 🎓 Quick Marketing Tips

### Content
- **Be personal:** Founder voice > corporate speak
- **Tell stories:** Behind-the-scenes > feature lists
- **Show results:** User wins > app capabilities
- **Be specific:** "HRV-based rest days" > "smart coaching"

### Social Media
- **Engage first, post second:** 30 min engagement > 3 posts
- **Reply to everything:** Every comment, every DM
- **Share others' content:** Retweet runners 5x more than self-promo
- **Use video:** Reels/TikToks get 3x more reach

### Email
- **Personalize:** Use name, signup position, goals
- **Provide value:** Every email teaches or inspires
- **One CTA:** Don't confuse with multiple asks
- **Test subject lines:** Emoji vs no emoji, question vs statement

### Conversion
- **Less friction:** 3 form fields > 10 form fields
- **Social proof:** "Join 200+ runners" updates live
- **Clear benefit:** "Lifetime 50% off" > "Early access"
- **Risk reversal:** "7-day free trial" + "14-day money-back"

## 🆘 When You're Stuck

### If signups are slow:
1. Check analytics: Where are people dropping off?
2. Ask 5 users: "What almost stopped you from signing up?"
3. Simplify: Fewer fields, clearer value prop
4. Add urgency: "Only X spots left" (if true)

### If engagement is low:
1. Interview users: "Why aren't you using it?"
2. Improve onboarding: Get to value faster
3. Send re-engagement email: "We miss you"
4. Add features they asked for

### If conversions to Premium are low:
1. Check if value is clear: Do users understand what they get?
2. Test pricing: A/B test $7.99 vs $9.99 vs $12.99
3. Improve upgrade prompts: Better placement, better copy
4. Talk to users: "What would make you upgrade?"

### If you're overwhelmed:
1. Focus on ONE channel this week
2. Batch content creation (1 day = 2 weeks of posts)
3. Use templates (this GTM folder!)
4. Ask for help: Beta testers, friends, communities
