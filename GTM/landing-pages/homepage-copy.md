## Problem Statement Section

### Headline
**Tired of Running Plans That Don't Stick?**

### Body Copy
You've downloaded the apps. Started the programs. Made the promises.

But here's what happens:
- Week 1: Motivated and crushing it
- Week 2: Life gets busy, you miss a day
- Week 3: The plan doesn't adjust. You feel guilty. You quit.

Sound familiar? You're not alone.

Most running apps treat you like a robot—rigid schedules, one-size-fits-all plans, and zero understanding of your real life.

**What if your running coach actually adapted to YOU?**
