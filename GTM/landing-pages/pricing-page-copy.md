## Value Proposition Reinforcement

### Headline
**Why Premium is Worth It**

### 3-Column Value Cards

#### 1. Save Money vs Personal Coaching
**Personal running coach: $100-300/month**
**Run-Smart Premium: $9.99/month**

Get AI-powered personalized coaching at a fraction of the cost. That's 90% savings for adaptive training plans and unlimited expert advice.

#### 2. Prevent Injuries
One running injury can cost hundreds in physical therapy and weeks of lost training.

Premium's recovery metrics and training load management help you avoid overtraining and stay healthy. Worth it for injury prevention alone.

#### 3. Achieve Your Goals Faster
Free features help you build the habit. Premium helps you hit your goals.

GPS tracking, advanced recovery insights, and unlimited AI coaching accelerate your progress. Most Premium users see measurable improvement within 4 weeks.
