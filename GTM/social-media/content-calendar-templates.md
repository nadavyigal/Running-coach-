Title: "5 Recovery Mistakes That Sabotage Your Running"
Subtitle: Swipe to learn →

**Slides 2-6 (Content):**
Each mistake on one slide:
- Mistake #1: Skipping rest days

**Caption Template:**
"Running more doesn't always mean getting better. 🏃‍♀️

The biggest mistake I see beginner runners make? Treating every run like a race.

Your body adapts during REST, not during the run itself. That's why our AI tracks your recovery and adjusts your plan daily.

### Type 3: Founder Story Post (Instagram)

**Image:** Founder photo or candid running shot

**Caption:**
"Why I built Run-Smart (it's personal)

I've failed at running 7 times.

Not because I hated it. Not because I couldn't do it.

But because every app treated me like a robot with a perfect schedule.

Missed Monday's run? The plan falls apart. Feel guilty. Quit by Week 3.

I got tired of it.

So I built what I wish existed:

✓ Plans that adapt when life happens
✓ AI coaching that actually understands context
✓ Recovery-first approach (not just more miles)
✓ Built for consistency, not perfection

No VC pressure to harvest your data.
No predatory pricing.
Just a tool that helps you build a habit that sticks.

That's Run-Smart.

Beta signups open. First 500 get lifetime 50% off.

### Type 4: Testimonial/UGC Post (Instagram)

**Image:** Screenshot of user's run OR reposted user story

**Caption:**
"'I've never made it past Week 2 before. Just finished Day 21!' - Sarah M.

This is what Run-Smart is about.

Not perfect runs. Not crushing PRs every week.

Just showing up. Staying consistent. Building the habit.

Sarah used the 21-Day Rookie Challenge. The AI adapted her plan 6 times when life got busy. She kept going anyway.

That's the power of a plan that works WITH you.

### Type 5: Twitter Thread (Build in Public)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
"I spent 6 months building an AI running coach.

Here's what I learned about GPT-4, habit formation, and why most running apps fail. 🧵"

**Tweet 2:**
"The problem with running apps isn't tracking. It's rigidity.

They assume you have a perfect schedule. Miss one workout and the whole plan falls apart.

That's why 80% of people quit by Week 3."

**Tweet 3:**
"So I asked: What if the plan adapted automatically?

Enter GPT-4.

Not for pre-written responses. But for actual coaching decisions: 'Should I run today? My HRV is down and I slept 4 hours.'"

**Tweet 4:**
"The AI considers:
- Your training history
- Sleep data (if connected)
- HRV trends
- Recent workout intensity
- Upcoming sessions

Then gives personalized advice. Like a real coach would."

**Tweet 5:**
"Example response:

'Your body needs recovery. Skip the tempo run. Do an easy 20-min jog OR rest completely. Both are valid. Your plan will adjust automatically. Listen to your body first.'"

**Tweet 6:**
"This is what beginner runners actually need:

Not more data. Not social competition.

But coaching that understands:
- Life happens
- Recovery matters
- Consistency > perfection"

**Tweet 7:**
"Built Run-Smart for that. AI-powered. Recovery-focused. Offline-first.

Beta open for first 500 users (lifetime 50% off).
