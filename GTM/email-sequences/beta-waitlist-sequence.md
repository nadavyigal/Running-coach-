## Email 1: Behind the Scenes (Day 3)

### Subject Line Options
- Why I built Run-Smart (it's personal)
- The truth about running apps (from a frustrated runner)
- I tried 12 running apps. They all failed me. Here's why.

### Preheader
The story of how Run-Smart came to be.

### Email Body

---

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: **How many running programs have you started... and quit?**

For me, it was seven.

Seven different apps. Seven "this time will be different" moments. Seven failed attempts.

### The Pattern Was Always the Same

**Week 1:** Excited. Crushing workouts. Feeling unstoppable.

**Week 2:** Life happens. I miss a day. The app doesn't care—my "plan" falls apart.

**Week 3:** Guilt sets in. The rigid schedule mocks me. I quit.

Sound familiar?

### The Problem Isn't You. It's the Apps.

Most running apps treat you like a robot:
- Rigid schedules that don't adapt
- One-size-fits-all plans
- No understanding of YOUR life, YOUR recovery, YOUR goals

They're designed for consistency in a perfect world. But life isn't perfect.

### So I Built Something Different

**Run-Smart** doesn't punish you for being human.

Missed a run? Your plan adjusts automatically overnight.
Had a terrible sleep? The AI suggests an easier workout.
Crushing your workouts? It increases the challenge.

It's like having a personal coach who actually GETS IT—but without the $200/month price tag.

### The Tech Behind It

- **GPT-4 AI** for truly personalized coaching (not just pre-programmed responses)
- **Recovery science** integrated (HRV, sleep, how you feel)
- **Habit formation research** baked into the 21-day Rookie Challenge

This isn't a running tracker. It's a running coach that adapts to YOUR life.

### You'll Get to Try It Soon

Your beta invite is coming [Estimated Timeframe]. In the meantime, here's a sneak peek:

## Email 2: Feature Highlight - AI Coaching (Day 7)

### Subject Line Options
- Sneak peek: Chat with your AI running coach
- "Is this thing actually reading my messages?" (Yes, it is)
- How the AI coaching actually works (not what you think)

### Preheader
See how conversational AI coaching compares to pre-programmed responses.

### Email Body

---

Hi [First Name],

Ever texted a running question into an app and gotten a useless canned response?

Yeah, me too.

**Example:**
You: "My knee is hurting after yesterday's run. Should I run today?"
App: "Remember to warm up before running! 🏃‍♀️"

Helpful. 😑

### That's Not How Run-Smart Works

Our AI coach is powered by **GPT-4**—the same tech behind ChatGPT. It actually READS your message, understands context, and gives personalized advice.

**Real example from our testing:**

**Runner:** "I'm supposed to do a tempo run today but my HRV is way down and I only slept 4 hours. What should I do?"

**Run-Smart AI:** "Your body is clearly signaling it needs recovery. Skip the tempo run today. Do an easy 20-minute recovery jog OR take a full rest day—both are valid. Your plan will adjust automatically. Tomorrow's workout will account for today's decision. Listen to your body first, always."

### See the Difference?

- Considers multiple data points (HRV, sleep)
- Gives specific, actionable advice
- Reassures you (no guilt for resting)
- Explains the plan will adapt

That's real coaching. Not a FAQ bot.

### Try It Yourself Soon

Your beta invite is coming [Timeframe]. When you're in, you'll get **10 free AI messages/month** (Free tier) or **unlimited messaging** (Premium—50% off for beta testers).

Questions you can ask:
- "Should I run today?"
- "How do I prevent shin splints?"
- "What pace should I run my easy runs?"
- "I missed 3 days—now what?"

The AI has context on your training plan, recent runs, and goals. It's not perfect, but it's shockingly good.

**Want a sneak peek?** Check out this conversation demo: [Link]

See you in your inbox soon,

[Founder Name]

P.S. The free tier includes 10 messages/month. Premium (just $4.99/month for beta testers) unlocks unlimited. More details coming in your beta invite.

### A Personal Note

Thank you for being one of the first 500 runners to try Run-Smart.

This app exists because I was frustrated with rigid running programs that didn't adapt to real life. I built what I wish existed.

Your feedback over the next few weeks will directly shape the product. Don't hold back—tell me what works, what doesn't, and what's missing.

Let's build this together.

Now go activate your access and record your first run! 🏃‍♀️

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you haven't activated your Run-Smart beta access yet.

No worries if you've been busy! Just wanted to check:

**Did you have trouble getting started?**

Common issues:
- Email went to spam (check promotions folder)

- Wasn't sure what to expect

If any of these apply, just reply and I'll personally help you get set up.

### Your Access Link (Still Active)

### Why You Should Give It a Shot

I get it—another running app. But here's what makes Run-Smart different:

1. **Actually adapts** when you miss workouts (no guilt, just adjustment)
2. **AI coaching** that gives real advice (not canned responses)
3. **Recovery-focused** (knows when you need rest)
4. **50% lifetime discount** for beta testers (seriously, forever)

**Worst case?** You try it for a week and it's not for you. No hard feelings.
**Best case?** You finally build a running habit that sticks.

Give it one run. If you hate it, I'll personally refund the... wait, it's free. 😄
