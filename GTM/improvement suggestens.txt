You are a senior product engineer + product manager working inside my running coach repo.

Your task:
Create a detailed Markdown product + engineering plan that specifies and breaks down the following 5 quick wins for my SmartRun application, so I can use it as the execution blueprint in Codex.

Project links (context):
- Live app: https://www.runsmart-ai.com/?screen=profile
- Vercel deployment: https://vercel.com/nadavyigal-gmailcoms-projects/running-coach
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/nadavyigal/Running-coach-.git

Quick wins to specify in detail:
1) GPS reliability + trust features (accuracy filtering, smoothing, auto-pause, quality indicator)
2) Post-run “Run Report” (AI + visuals + share card)
3) Audio coaching MVP (interval cues + pacing prompts)
4) Streaks + weekly goal widget + weekly recap
5) Plan → execution loop (“Today’s workout” + completion + light adaptation)

RULES
- DO NOT implement code changes yet (this step is only documentation + plan).
- DO scan the repo first and reference REAL files, components, DB tables, and routes.
- If something is missing, mark it clearly as “Missing / To Add” and propose the simplest addition.
- Be specific, practical, and execution-ready (checklists, acceptance criteria, event names, etc.).

STEP 0 — REPO SCAN (must do first)
1) Inspect the current structure:
   - Find the run recording screen/component (likely something like record-screen.tsx).
   - Find GPS tracking logic (watchPosition usage, permission flow, cleanup).
   - Find run storage model/table (runs), and any “runReport” field.
   - Find AI endpoints/routes (OpenAI usage) related to insights, plans, or reports.
   - Find any analytics setup (PostHog events or client).
   - Find current UI screens: Record Run, Run History, Run Details, Plans (if exists), Profile.

2) Write a short “Current State Summary” section in the doc:
   - What exists today (features that already work)
   - What is partially implemented
   - Where the known pain is (GPS accuracy, missing report UX, etc.)
   - The most relevant file paths you found

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
Create ONE markdown file in the repo:

/docs/quickwins/SMART_RUN_QUICK_WINS_EXECUTION_PLAN.md

The file must include:

# SMART RUN — 5 QUICK WINS EXECUTION PLAN

## 1) Executive Summary
- What we’re building (1 paragraph)
- Why these 5 quick wins matter (1 paragraph)
- What success looks like in 14 days (bullets)

## 2) Benchmark-Inspired Product Principles (short)
Include 6–10 principles like:
- Trust before features (GPS accuracy first)
- “Win in 10 minutes” onboarding
- Plan → execute → analyze → adapt loop
- Audio-first coaching as retention
- Shareable moments

## 3) Quick Wins Overview Table
A table with columns:
- Quick Win
- User Value
- Primary KPI
- Effort (S/M/L)
- Dependencies
- Risk Level
- Suggested Order

## 4) Detailed Specs (repeat the following template for each quick win)

For EACH quick win, include:

### (A) Goal / Why it matters
- 2–4 bullets

### (B) User Stories
- 3–6 user stories (runner-first)

### (C) UX Requirements (very concrete)
- What screens change
- What new UI components appear
- What states exist (loading/error/empty)
- Copy text examples (short)

### (D) Data + Logic Requirements
- What data do we need during the run / after run
- Calculations needed (pace, splits, smoothing, streak logic, etc.)
- Edge cases & constraints

### (E) Backend / API / DB changes (if needed)
- New or updated fields
- New API routes (if needed)
- Contract example (JSON)
- Must stay minimal

### (F) Implementation Task Breakdown (engineer checklist)
Provide a checklist with subtasks grouped by:
- Frontend
- Backend
- Data/DB
- AI prompts (if relevant)
- Analytics
Each subtask should be actionable, e.g. “Add `gps_quality_state` computed from accuracy rolling average”.

### (G) Acceptance Criteria (testable)
Provide 6–12 checks per quick win:
- Functional checks
- Performance checks
- Reliability checks
- Visual/UI checks

### (H) Analytics / PostHog Events
Define the exact event names and properties for each feature:
Examples:
- run_start
- run_end
- gps_quality_changed
- auto_pause_triggered
- report_generated
- report_viewed
- share_clicked
- audio_prompt_played
- streak_updated
- weekly_recap_viewed
- workout_started
- workout_completed

For each event, specify:
- Trigger moment
- Required properties
- Why it matters

### (I) Rollout Plan (feature flags)
- Flag name
- Who gets it first
- How to verify safely

### (J) Risks & Mitigations
- 3–6 items per quick win

### (K) Definition of Done
- 4–6 bullets

## 5) Execution Timeline (7–14 days)
Provide a realistic roadmap that sequences the work:

- Day 1–2: GPS reliability foundation
- Day 3–4: Run Report MVP
- Day 5: Share card
- Day 6–7: Audio coaching MVP
- Day 8–9: Streaks + weekly goal
- Day 10–12: Plan → execution loop
- Day 13–14: Hardening + QA + analytics review

Include a “ship order” and why.

## 6) QA Plan (must be strong)
- Manual test cases
- GPS simulation strategy
- Comparison testing (Garmin vs SmartRun)
- Regression checks for mobile browsers

## 7) “Nice-to-have later” (do not scope creep)
List 6–12 future items (e.g., Garmin structured workouts push, advanced VO2max estimation, etc.)

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS PER QUICK WIN (VERY IMPORTANT)
Below are the minimum details you must include for each quick win.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK WIN #1 — GPS RELIABILITY + TRUST FEATURES
Must include:
- GPS quality indicator logic (accuracy rolling avg)
- Filtering & smoothing rules (drop points above threshold, median smoothing)
- Auto-pause rules (speed threshold + time hysteresis)
- Distance sanity validation
- Cleanup bug checks (watchPosition clear)
- UI: live distance/pace stability, “GPS Weak” warning

--------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK WIN #2 — POST-RUN RUN REPORT (AI + VISUALS + SHARE CARD)
Must include:
- Report structure sections (summary, pacing, splits, insights, next step)
- Minimum charts (pace over time, split table)
- AI prompt outline (1 insight + 1 improvement + 1 next workout suggestion)
- Where report is generated (client vs server) and stored (runs table runReport)
- Share card design spec (IG story + square)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK WIN #3 — AUDIO COACHING MVP
Must include:
- TTS approach (web speech / fallback)
- Cue types: pace correction + interval timer prompts
- At least 3 workout presets (easy run, intervals, tempo)
- Safety: do not spam prompts, cooldown time between prompts
- UI toggles: enable/disable voice + volume/test button

--------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK WIN #4 — STREAKS + WEEKLY GOALS + WEEKLY RECAP
Must include:
- Streak definition (consecutive weeks with ≥X runs)
- Weekly goal tracking (target runs/week)
- Recap delivery method (in-app banner + optional email later)
- UI widget spec on Home/Profile
- Metrics: retention, weekly active runners, streak continuation

--------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK WIN #5 — PLAN → EXECUTION LOOP (“TODAY’S WORKOUT”)
Must include:
- “Today’s Workout” card requirements
- Workout representation model (warmup/main/cooldown blocks)
- Completion logic (auto-complete on run end)
- Light adaptation logic (if missed workout → reschedule)
- Minimal plan generation contract (even if AI-powered later)

FINAL OUTPUT
- Create the markdown file at:
  /docs/quickwins/SMART_RUN_QUICK_WINS_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
- Populate it with the full content per the structure above.
- Use real repo file paths wherever possible.
- If you need to assume something, label it clearly as Assumption.

Now execute the repo scan, then write the markdown file.
