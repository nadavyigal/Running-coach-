## Company Overview

### Elevator Pitch (50 words)
Run-Smart is an AI-powered running coach that adapts to your life. Using GPT-4, it creates personalized training plans that automatically adjust when you miss workouts, integrates recovery metrics (HRV, sleep), and provides conversational coaching. Built for runners who want consistency over perfection.

### Full Description (150 words)
Run-Smart is a Progressive Web App that revolutionizes running training with adaptive AI coaching. Unlike traditional running apps with rigid schedules, Run-Smart uses GPT-4 to generate personalized 14-21 day training plans that automatically adjust overnight when users miss workouts or show signs of insufficient recovery.

The app integrates advanced recovery metrics including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), sleep data, and subjective wellness tracking to provide coaching that knows when to push and when to rest. Its 21-Day Rookie Challenge leverages habit formation science to help beginners build lasting running habits.

As a privacy-first PWA, Run-Smart stores data locally on users' devices, works fully offline, and doesn't require app store downloads. The conversational AI coach provides contextual advice (not canned responses), making personalized running coaching accessible at a fraction of traditional coaching costs.

### Origin Story
Run-Smart was created by [Founder Name], a runner frustrated by the rigidity of existing running apps. After failing to stick with seven different running programs, [he/she] recognized the core problem: apps that don't adapt to real life.

"I'd miss Monday's run because of work, and my entire week's plan would be ruined. I'd feel guilty, lose motivation, and quit by Week 3," explains [Founder Name]. "I built Run-Smart to solve that. Your plan should work with your life, not against it."

Built as a solo founder project over six months, Run-Smart combines expertise in software development, behavioral science, and personal running experience to create a coaching tool that prioritizes consistency and recovery over rigid perfection.

## Interview Prep - Common Questions

**Q: What problem does Run-Smart solve?**
A: Most running apps fail because they're rigid. Miss a workout and your plan falls apart. Run-Smart automatically adapts your training plan when life happens—no guilt, no manual rescheduling, just smart adjustment.

**Q: Why did you build this?**
A: I personally failed to stick with running seven times. Every app assumed I had a perfect schedule. I built what I wish existed: coaching that works WITH your life.

**Q: How is this different from Nike Run Club or Strava?**
A: Three ways: (1) True AI adaptation using GPT-4, (2) Recovery-first approach with HRV/sleep integration, (3) Conversational coaching vs canned responses. We're built for consistency, not perfection.

**Q: Isn't AI coaching inferior to human coaches?**
A: It's different, not inferior. AI provides 24/7 availability, instant plan adjustments, and costs 95% less. It's not replacing elite coaching—it's making quality coaching accessible to millions who can't afford $200/month.

**Q: How do you make money?**
A: Freemium model. Core features free forever (habit-building tools). Premium ($9.99/month) unlocks GPS tracking, unlimited AI chat, wearable sync, advanced recovery metrics.

**Q: What about privacy? You're collecting health data.**
A: Privacy-first by design. All data stored locally on users' devices first. They control exports and deletions. GDPR compliant. No selling data, no ads.

**Q: Who's your target user?**
A: Beginner to intermediate runners (50% of all runners). People who want to build the habit but keep quitting because existing apps don't fit their real life.

**Q: What's next for Run-Smart?**
A: Beta with 500 users for feedback. Iterate based on their input. Public launch in 3 months. Long-term: Become the most adaptive, recovery-focused running coach available.

**Q: Why bootstrap vs raising funding?**
A: Maintain control and stay mission-focused. I'm not pressured to harvest user data or chase growth at all costs. This is about building the right product, not an exit.
