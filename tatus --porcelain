    feat: add Restart Onboarding button to Today screen
    
    Added a user-friendly "Restart Onboarding" button next to the streak indicator
    that allows existing users to reset all data and start fresh with a new
    AI-generated training plan.
    
    Features:
    - Button placed next to streak indicator in Today screen header
    - Confirmation dialog with detailed warning about data loss
    - Lists all data that will be deleted (plan, runs, profile, streak)
    - Clears localStorage and deletes IndexedDB database
    - Shows toast notification before reload
    - Reloads page to trigger onboarding flow
    
    This solves the issue where existing users who completed onboarding before
    the AI plan generation feature can now regenerate their plan without manual
    URL parameters.
    
    User experience:
    1. Click "Restart Onboarding" button
    2. Read warning in confirmation dialog
    3. Confirm or cancel
    4. If confirmed: data cleared → page reloads → onboarding starts
    5. Complete onboarding → AI plan generated
