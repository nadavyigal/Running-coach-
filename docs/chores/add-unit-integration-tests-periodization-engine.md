## Description
Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for the plan periodization engine to ensure reliability and maintainability of the advanced plan customization feature.

## Related Story
- Story 6.3: Advanced Plan Customization (Status: Done)

## Background
During QA review of Story 6.3, it was identified that while the periodization engine implementation is excellent, comprehensive testing is needed for production confidence. This chore addresses the tech debt flagged during QA.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Unit tests cover all periodization algorithm functions
2. Integration tests validate plan generation API endpoints
3. Performance tests ensure <3s response time for plan generation
4. Validation tests verify workout safety and progression
5. Test coverage reaches 90% for periodization-related code
6. All tests pass consistently in CI/CD pipeline

## Tasks

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test periodization phase calculation algorithms
- [ ] Test workout type selection logic for each phase
- [ ] Test fitness level assessment functions
- [ ] Test time constraint analysis
- [ ] Test taper strategy generation
- [ ] Test race goal validation functions
- [ ] Test plan safety and progression validation

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test `/api/training-plan/generate-advanced` endpoint
- [ ] Test `/api/training-plan/race-goal` endpoint
- [ ] Test `/api/training-plan/customize` endpoint
- [ ] Test `/api/training-plan/preview` endpoint
- [ ] Test plan generation with various user profiles
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid inputs
- [ ] Test authorization and access control

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Test plan generation response time (<3s)
- [ ] Test concurrent plan generation requests
- [ ] Test memory usage for large training plans
- [ ] Test database query optimization

### Validation Tests
- [ ] Test workout progression safety
- [ ] Test volume increase limits
- [ ] Test intensity distribution validation
- [ ] Test race goal feasibility assessment
- [ ] Test plan conflict resolution

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All unit tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Performance tests meet requirements
- [ ] Validation tests ensure safety
- [ ] Tests run successfully in CI/CD
- [ ] Documentation updated with test examples
- [ ] QA team validates test completeness

## Technical Notes
- Use Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Implement performance testing with realistic data sets
- Ensure tests are deterministic and repeatable
- Add test data fixtures for various user scenarios

## Dependencies
- Story 6.3 implementation (completed)
- Existing test infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Success Metrics
- 90%+ test coverage for periodization code
- All tests pass consistently
- <3s response time maintained
- Zero critical bugs in production
- Improved developer confidence in periodization features
