# Epic 5: Social Sharing & Community Features

**Epic Number:** 5

**Title:** Social Sharing & Community Features

**Description:** Enable users to share their running achievements, completed sessions, and progress with friends or on social platforms. Foster a sense of community and accountability, supporting habit formation and increasing engagement by 10%.

**Epic Goal**

Allow users to easily share milestones, badges, and run summaries, and optionally connect with a small community cohort. This will drive motivation, reinforce positive behaviors, and provide social proof of progress, supporting the MVP’s retention and engagement goals (see PRD §4, §8).

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: User profile, badge system, run/session logging, onboarding, and dashboard (see PRD §8, Architecture §2)
- Technology stack: Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS, Dexie.js local database, OpenAI GPT-4o integration
- Integration points: Profile screen, Today dashboard, Badge cabinet, Run summary modals

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Social sharing buttons for badges and run summaries, optional invite/join cohort feature, backend endpoint for shareable links
- How it integrates: Adds UI elements to profile, badge cabinet, and run summary modals; new API route for generating shareable content; optional cohort join via invite code
- Success criteria: Users can share achievements externally, join a cohort, and see community stats; 10% increase in engagement metrics

**Stories:**

*   **5.1: Share Badge Achievements:** Allow users to share unlocked badges to social media or via link
*   **5.2: Share Run Summaries:** Enable sharing of completed run/session summaries with friends
*   **5.3: Join Community Cohort:** Users can join a small cohort via invite code and see group progress
*   **5.4: Community Stats Widget:** Display anonymized cohort stats on dashboard/profile

**Risk Mitigation**

- **Primary Risk:** Privacy concerns or accidental oversharing of personal data
