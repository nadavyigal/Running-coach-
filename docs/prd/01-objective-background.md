## 1 · Objective

Deliver a **5-screen mobile MVP** that proves Run-Smart can:
1. Build a sustainable running habit for novices.
2. Showcase the value of adaptive AI coaching.
3. Achieve ≥40% Day-30 retention with ≥55% weekly plan-completion.
4. Gather baseline monetisation data (conversion experiment ready, paywall disabled).

## 2 · Background & Opportunity

Recreational runners lack affordable, tailored coaching. Existing apps skew toward social competition. Run-Smart focuses on **intrinsic motivation**—personal milestones, adaptive plans, and habit science.

**Market Gap:**
- Existing solutions focus on social competition and data overload
- Novice runners need guidance, not overwhelming metrics
- Habit formation requires consistent cues and quick feedback loops

**Our Approach:**
- Intrinsic motivation over extrinsic rewards
- Adaptive AI coaching that learns user preferences
- Habit science integration for sustainable behavior change
