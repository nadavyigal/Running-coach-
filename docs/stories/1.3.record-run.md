# Story 1.3: Record Run Screen

## Status
✅ DONE

## Story
**As a** novice runner who has seen today's workout on the dashboard,
**I want** to record my run with live GPS tracking, see real-time metrics, and save the activity,
**so that** I can track my progress, complete my planned workout, and have my adaptive plan automatically updated.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Display live GPS tracking with route visualization on map
2. Show real-time metrics: time, distance, pace, calories (estimated)
3. Provide start/pause/resume/stop controls with clear visual states
4. Allow manual activity entry if GPS is unavailable or user preference
5. Save run data with GPS path, metrics, and link to planned workout
6. Integrate with adaptive plan recalculation after run completion
7. Handle GPS permissions and graceful degradation
8. Provide audio cues for pace/distance milestones (optional)
9. Export GPX file capability for external app integration
10. Navigate back to Today Dashboard with updated progress

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture
Based on the fullstack architecture document:
- **Main Component**: `record-screen.tsx` in the screens directory
- **Data Models**: Extend Run interface in `lib/db.ts` for GPS data storage
- **Utilities**: Add GPS and metrics calculation functions to `lib/utils.ts`
- **Integration**: Update plan recalculation logic in `lib/planGenerator.ts`

### Key Technical Considerations
1. **GPS Data Storage**: Store GPS path as JSON string in Run.gpsPath field
2. **Real-time Updates**: Use React state and useEffect for live metric updates
3. **Performance**: Optimize map rendering and GPS coordinate storage
4. **Privacy**: Ensure GPS data storage complies with user consent from onboarding
5. **Battery**: Implement efficient GPS sampling to minimize battery drain

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Accessibility**: Full screen reader support with descriptive labels
- **Visual Design**: Consistent with Today Dashboard styling and dark theme
- **Mobile-First**: Touch-friendly controls optimized for running usage
- **Feedback**: Clear audio/haptic feedback for control interactions

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] GPS coordinate processing and storage functions
- [ ] Metrics calculation (pace, distance, calories) accuracy
- [ ] Timer functionality (start, pause, resume, stop)
- [ ] Database operations for run data storage

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end run recording flow from Today Dashboard
- [ ] Adaptive plan update after run completion
- [ ] GPS permission handling and fallback scenarios
- [ ] Manual entry form validation and submission

### Accessibility Tests
- [ ] Screen reader navigation through all controls
- [ ] Keyboard-only operation capability
- [ ] High contrast mode compatibility
- [ ] Voice control compatibility (if available)

## Business Value
- **Primary**: Enables core value proposition of run tracking and progress measurement
- **Secondary**: Generates data for adaptive coaching and habit formation
- **Metrics Impact**: Directly contributes to plan completion rate and user retention

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: GPS reliability across different devices and browsers
- **Medium Risk**: Battery usage optimization for longer runs
- **Low Risk**: Map rendering performance on older devices
- **Mitigation**: Robust fallback to manual entry, efficient GPS sampling

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Approach
Implemented a comprehensive GPS-enabled record screen with the following architecture:
- **Main Component**: Enhanced `record-screen.tsx` with full GPS tracking functionality
- **Manual Entry**: Created `manual-run-modal.tsx` for GPS fallback scenarios
- **GPS Integration**: Used browser Geolocation API with proper permission handling
- **Real-time Updates**: React state management with useEffect for live metric tracking
- **Database Integration**: Full integration with existing Dexie.js database structure

### Technical Decisions
- **GPS Strategy**: Used browser Geolocation API instead of external mapping library for MVP simplicity
- **Route Visualization**: Implemented SVG-based route rendering for lightweight performance
- **Permission Handling**: Implemented progressive permission request with graceful fallback
- **Metrics Calculation**: Used Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation between GPS points
- **Database Design**: Leveraged existing Run interface with GPS path stored as JSON string
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries with user-friendly messaging

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Type Safety**: Handled Workout 'rest' type conversion to Run 'other' type for database compatibility
- **GPS Accuracy**: Implemented accuracy validation and visual feedback for GPS quality
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimized GPS coordinate sampling to minimize battery drain
- **Fallback UX**: Created comprehensive manual entry with quick templates for common scenarios
- **Timer Accuracy**: Used Date.now() timestamps for precise duration calculation independent of interval timing
