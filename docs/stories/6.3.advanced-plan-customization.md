# Story 6.3: Advanced Plan Customization

## Status
done

## Story
**As a** competitive runner,
**I want** to customize my training plan for specific race goals,
**so that** I can optimize my preparation for target events.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Allow users to set specific race goals (distance, target time, race date, and location)
2. Generate periodized training plans with distinct base, build, and peak phases
3. Adjust plan automatically based on current fitness level and available training time
4. Include specialized workouts (tempo runs, intervals, long runs, recovery runs, race-pace runs)
5. Provide race-day preparation guidance including taper strategies
6. Support multiple goal races with different priorities (A, B, C races)
7. Enable manual plan adjustments while maintaining overall training structure
8. Integrate with existing injury prevention recommendations to ensure safe progression

## Acceptance Tests

### Race Goal Setting
```gherkin
Given a user wants to train for a specific race
When they set up a new race goal
Then they should be able to:
  - Enter race details (distance, date, target time)
  - Set race priority (A, B, or C race)
  - View estimated training timeline
  - See fitness requirements analysis
```

### Periodized Plan Generation
```gherkin
Given a user has set a race goal 16 weeks in the future
When the system generates their training plan
Then the plan should include:
  - Base phase: weeks 1-10 (60% easy aerobic running)
  - Build phase: weeks 11-15 (30% includes tempo and threshold work)
  - Peak phase: weeks 13-16 (10% race-specific workouts and taper)
  - Progressive volume increase in base phase
  - Intensity increase in build phase
  - Volume reduction in peak phase
```

### Plan Customization
```gherkin
Given a user has a generated training plan
When they want to customize specific workouts
Then they should be able to:
  - Move workouts to different days
  - Adjust workout intensity or duration
  - Replace workout types while maintaining plan balance
  - See warnings for modifications that may impact goals
```

### Multiple Goal Management
```gherkin
Given a user has multiple races in their calendar
When they view their training plan
Then they should see:
  - Primary goal (A race) driving main plan structure
  - Secondary goals (B/C races) incorporated as tune-up events
  - Clear indication of which phase serves which goal
  - Conflict resolution for overlapping preparation periods
```
