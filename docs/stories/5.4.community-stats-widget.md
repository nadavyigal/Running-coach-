# Story 5.4: Community Stats Widget

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see anonymized cohort stats on my dashboard/profile,
**so that** I can feel motivated by group progress and accountability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Display anonymized cohort stats on dashboard/profile

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement backend API for retrieving anonymized cohort statistics. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Define API endpoint (e.g., `/api/cohort/stats`).
  - [ ] Implement logic to aggregate and anonymize cohort data (e.g., total runs, average distance, active members).
  - [ ] Ensure data privacy and security.
- [ ] Develop a new UI component for the Community Stats Widget. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Design a visually appealing widget to display key cohort metrics.
  - [ ] Integrate Radix UI primitives (e.g., `components/ui/Card`, `components/ui/Badge`).
  - [ ] Ensure UI follows dark-first, mobile-first design patterns.
- [ ] Integrate the Community Stats Widget into existing screens. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add the widget to `today-screen.tsx`.
  - [ ] Add the widget to `profile-screen.tsx`.
- [ ] Implement client-side logic to fetch and display cohort stats. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Call the new API route to get cohort statistics.
  - [ ] Update the UI component with fetched data.
  - [ ] Handle loading states and errors gracefully.
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests.
  - [ ] Test the new API route for correct data aggregation and anonymization.
  - [ ] Test the Community Stats Widget UI and data display.
  - [ ] Verify integration points in `today-screen.tsx` and `profile-screen.tsx`.
- [ ] Ensure privacy and data exposure are handled correctly.
  - [ ] Confirm only anonymized data is displayed.
  - [ ] No individual user data is exposed.

## Dev Notes
- **Data Models:**
  - `Cohort` and `Run` interfaces from `lib/db.ts` will be used for data aggregation. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#3. Logic & Data Models]
- **API Specifications:**
  - New API route `app/api/cohort/stats/route.ts` will be required to handle GET requests for anonymized cohort statistics. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#4. API Routes]
- **Component Specifications:**
  - `today-screen.tsx` and `profile-screen.tsx` will need to incorporate the new widget. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#2. Screens & UI Components]
  - `components/ui/Card` for the widget container. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#2. Screens & UI Components]
  - `components/ui/Badge` for displaying key metrics. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#2. Screens & UI Components]
- **File Locations:**
  - New API route: `V0/app/api/cohort/stats/route.ts`
  - New UI component: `V0/components/community-stats-widget.tsx`
  - Modifications to: `V0/components/today-screen.tsx`, `V0/components/profile-screen.tsx`
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Existing profile, badge, and run summary screens load without breaking. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md#Compatibility Requirements]
  - Sharing features tested for privacy and correct data exposure. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md#Definition of Done]
  - UI changes follow dark-first, mobile-first design patterns. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md#Compatibility Requirements]
  - Performance impact is minimal on dashboard/profile load time. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md#Compatibility Requirements]
