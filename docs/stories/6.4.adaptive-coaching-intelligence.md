## Acceptance Tests

### Feedback Learning
```gherkin
Given a user consistently rates tempo workouts as "too difficult"
When the AI coach generates future tempo workouts
Then the coach should:
  - Reduce intensity by 5-10% compared to standard recommendations
  - Provide more detailed pacing guidance
  - Suggest longer warm-up periods
  - Offer alternative workout options
```

### Coaching Style Adaptation
```gherkin
Given a user prefers detailed, analytical communication
When they interact with the AI coach
Then the coach should:
  - Provide data-driven explanations for recommendations
  - Include specific metrics and targets
  - Offer technical details about training adaptations
  - Use precise, scientific language
```

### Pattern Recognition
```gherkin
Given a user consistently performs better on Tuesday/Thursday workouts
When the AI coach plans future training
Then the coach should:
  - Schedule key workouts on these preferred days
  - Suggest lighter workouts on historically difficult days
  - Proactively ask about schedule preferences
  - Adapt weekly planning to user's natural rhythm
```

### Context Awareness
```gherkin
Given it's raining and the user has indoor training options
When the user asks for workout recommendations
Then the coach should:
  - Suggest treadmill or indoor alternatives
  - Adjust expectations for outdoor performance metrics
  - Provide indoor-specific motivation and tips
  - Remember this preference for future rainy days
```

### Coaching Consistency
```gherkin
Given a user has established rapport with the AI coach
When they interact across different features (chat, planning, analytics)
Then the coach should:
  - Maintain consistent personality and communication style
  - Reference previous conversations and established goals
  - Show continuity in coaching philosophy and approach
  - Avoid contradicting previous advice without explanation
```
