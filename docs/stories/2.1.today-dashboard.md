# Story 2.1: Today Dashboard

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** novice runner who has completed onboarding,
**I want** to see today's scheduled activity and quick actions on the main dashboard,

5. Navigate to record screen when "Record Run" is tapped

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3 (Record Run) is complete - this dashboard will provide the entry point to that recording functionality.

### Data Models
[Source: V0/lib/db.ts]
- **User Interface**: `{ id?: number; name?: string; goal: 'habit' | 'distance' | 'speed'; experience: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'; preferredTimes: string[]; daysPerWeek: number; consents: {...}; onboardingComplete: boolean; ... }`
- **Plan Interface**: `{ id?: number; userId: number; title: string; description?: string; startDate: Date; endDate: Date; totalWeeks: number; isActive: boolean; ... }`
- **Workout Interface**: `{ id?: number; planId: number; week: number; day: string; type: 'easy' | 'tempo' | 'intervals' | 'long' | 'time-trial' | 'hill' | 'rest'; distance: number; duration?: number; notes?: string; completed: boolean; scheduledDate: Date; ... }`
- **Key Database Function**: `dbUtils.getTodaysWorkout(userId)` returns today's workout or undefined

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#4]
- No specific API endpoints required for this story
- Uses local Dexie.js database operations only

### Component Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- **Main Component**: `today-screen.tsx` – Today dashboard, calendar strip, workout card, quick actions
- **Modals Referenced**: `add-activity-modal.tsx` (for Add Activity CTA)
- **Navigation**: `bottom-navigation.tsx` – Tab bar navigation
- **UI Primitives**: Available in `components/ui/` – Card, Button, Badge, etc. (Radix UI + Tailwind)

### File Locations
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- Main component: `components/today-screen.tsx`
- Add activity modal: `components/add-activity-modal.tsx`
- Database utilities: `lib/db.ts` (dbUtils functions)
- Navigation: `components/bottom-navigation.tsx`
- UI components: `components/ui/` directory

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs - implementing standard React component testing with focus on:
- Component rendering for different states
- Database integration testing
- Navigation flow testing
- User interaction testing

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/prd.md#7]
- Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS application
- Dark-first design approach
- Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Mobile-focused responsive design
- Performance: App cold start < 1.5s

### Testing
- Create unit tests in `components/today-screen.test.tsx`
- Test calendar strip functionality
- Test workout card display for different workout types
- Test navigation to record screen and activity modal
- Test rest day vs workout day scenarios
