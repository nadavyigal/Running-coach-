5. Step 4: Optional RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) slider for fitness assessment
6. Step 5: Collect user's age
7. Step 6: Collect weekly availability (days and preferred time slots)
8. Step 7: GDPR consent and privacy policy acceptance
9. Step 8: Summary and confirmation screen

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project - no previous story context available.

### Data Models
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#3]
- **User Interface**: `{ id?: number; name?: string; goal: 'habit' | 'distance' | 'speed'; ... }`
- **Plan Interface**: `{ id?: number; userId: number; ... }`
- **Workout Interface**: `{ id?: number; planId: number; week: number; ... }`
- Database persistence handled via Dexie.js schema in `lib/db.ts`

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#4]
- **Plan Generation API**: `app/api/generate-plan/route.ts` - Handles POST requests to generate a plan for a user
- Expected to integrate with plan generation service for creating the 14-day rookie challenge

### Component Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- **Main Component**: `onboarding-screen.tsx` – 5-step wizard, goal selection, consent
- **UI Primitives**: Available in `components/ui/` – Card, Button, Badge, Dialog, etc. (Radix UI + Tailwind)
- **Navigation**: `bottom-navigation.tsx` – Tab bar navigation (for post-onboarding)

### File Locations
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- Main onboarding component: `components/onboarding-screen.tsx`
- Plan generation logic: `lib/planGenerator.ts`
- Database models: `lib/db.ts`
- API route: `app/api/generate-plan/route.ts`

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs - following standard React testing practices with unit tests for components and integration tests for API calls.

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/prd.md#7]
- Mobile: React Native (Note: Architecture shows Next.js - needs clarification)
- Dark-first design approach
- Performance: App cold start < 1.5s
- Accessibility: WCAG AA compliance required
- Analytics: PostHog cloud integration

### PostHog Analytics Integration
[Source: docs/prd.md#10]
- Event: `onboard_complete`
- Required Properties: age, goalDist, rookieChallenge
- Trigger: Finish wizard

### Privacy & Compliance
[Source: docs/prd.md#5]
- GDPR consent required in onboarding flow
- Privacy compliance for health data

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: Follow standard React testing patterns (likely `__tests__` or `.test.tsx` files)
- Testing frameworks: Standard React testing library (based on Next.js setup)
- Specific requirements for this story:
  - Unit tests for each wizard step component
  - Integration tests for plan generation API calls
  - Accessibility testing for WCAG AA compliance
  - Analytics event tracking verification

## QA Results
## QA Results

### Review Date: יום חמישי, 17 ביולי 2025
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is generally good. The code is well-structured and follows a clear component-based approach. Error handling for plan generation is improved.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: V0/components/onboarding-screen.tsx
  - **Change**: Added import for `planAdjustmentService`.
  - **Why**: The service was used but not imported, leading to a runtime error.
  - **How**: Ensures the `planAdjustmentService` is correctly initialized and used.
- **File**: V0/lib/planGenerator.ts
  - **Change**: Modified `generateFallbackPlan` to accept `rookie_challenge` parameter.
  - **Why**: The `rookie_challenge` flag was not being passed to the fallback plan generation, leading to inconsistent plan types.
  - **How**: Ensures the fallback plan correctly reflects the rookie challenge.
- **File**: V0/components/onboarding-screen.tsx
  - **Change**: Added a new step (Step 5) to collect user's age. Updated `totalSteps` from 7 to 8. Adjusted `canProceed` logic and `renderStep` to accommodate the new step.
  - **Why**: The story required `age` to be tracked with the `onboard_complete` event, but it was not being collected.
  - **How**: Collects the user's age and integrates it into the onboarding flow and user data.
- **File**: V0/components/onboarding-screen.tsx
  - **Change**: Modified `trackEngagementEvent` call to include `age` and `goalDist` properties.
  - **Why**: The story's acceptance criteria required `age` and `goalDist` to be tracked with the `onboard_complete` event.
  - **How**: Ensures all required properties are sent to PostHog analytics.
- **File**: V0/components/onboarding-screen.test.tsx
  - **Change**: Updated test cases to include interaction with the new age input field and modified the `trackEngagementEvent` assertion to expect `age` and `goalDist`.
  - **Why**: To ensure the new age collection step is properly tested and the analytics event tracking is accurate.
  - **How**: Aligns the test with the updated component functionality and analytics requirements.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All original ACs are met, and new requirements for age collection and analytics properties are also met.)

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Refactored `onboarding-screen.tsx` to include age collection.
- [x] Ensured `planAdjustmentService` is correctly imported and used.
- [x] Updated `generateFallbackPlan` to handle `rookie_challenge` flag.
- [x] Verified `onboard_complete` event includes `age` and `goalDist`.

### Security Review
No new security concerns introduced. Data handling for age and health data is covered by existing consent mechanisms.

### Performance Considerations
The changes are minimal and should not impact performance significantly. The addition of one step to the onboarding flow is negligible.

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done
