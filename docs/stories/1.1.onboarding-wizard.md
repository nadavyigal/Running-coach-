## Status
approved 

## Story
**As a** novice runner,
**I want** to complete a 5-step onboarding wizard that captures my running goals, availability, and preferences,
**so that** I can receive a personalized 21-day rookie challenge and start building a sustainable running habit.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Display a 5-step onboarding wizard with clear progress indication
2. Step 1: Capture user's primary running goal (habit building, distance, or speed improvement)
3. Step 2: Collect weekly availability (days and preferred time slots)
4. Step 3: Optional RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) slider for fitness assessment
5. Step 4: GDPR consent and privacy policy acceptance
6. Step 5: Summary and confirmation screen
7. Generate and save a 14-day training plan with `rookie_challenge=true` flag
8. Navigate to Today Dashboard upon completion
9. Track `onboard_complete` event with PostHog analytics
10. Handle form validation and error states gracefully
11. Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project - no previous story context available.

### Data Models
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#3]
- **User Interface**: `{ id?: number; name?: string; goal: 'habit' | 'distance' | 'speed'; ... }`
- **Plan Interface**: `{ id?: number; userId: number; ... }`
- **Workout Interface**: `{ id?: number; planId: number; week: number; ... }`
- Database persistence handled via Dexie.js schema in `lib/db.ts`

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#4]
- **Plan Generation API**: `app/api/generate-plan/route.ts` - Handles POST requests to generate a plan for a user
- Expected to integrate with plan generation service for creating the 14-day rookie challenge

### Component Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- **Main Component**: `onboarding-screen.tsx` – 5-step wizard, goal selection, consent
- **UI Primitives**: Available in `components/ui/` – Card, Button, Badge, Dialog, etc. (Radix UI + Tailwind)
- **Navigation**: `bottom-navigation.tsx` – Tab bar navigation (for post-onboarding)

### File Locations
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- Main onboarding component: `components/onboarding-screen.tsx`
- Plan generation logic: `lib/planGenerator.ts`
- Database models: `lib/db.ts`
- API route: `app/api/generate-plan/route.ts`

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs - following standard React testing practices with unit tests for components and integration tests for API calls.

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/prd.md#7]
- Mobile: React Native (Note: Architecture shows Next.js - needs clarification)
- Dark-first design approach
- Performance: App cold start < 1.5s
- Accessibility: WCAG AA compliance required
- Analytics: PostHog cloud integration

### PostHog Analytics Integration
[Source: docs/prd.md#10]
- Event: `onboard_complete`
- Required Properties: age, goalDist, rookieChallenge
- Trigger: Finish wizard

### Privacy & Compliance
[Source: docs/prd.md#5]
- GDPR consent required in onboarding flow
- Privacy compliance for health data

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: Follow standard React testing patterns (likely `__tests__` or `.test.tsx` files)
- Testing frameworks: Standard React testing library (based on Next.js setup)
- Specific requirements for this story:
  - Unit tests for each wizard step component
  - Integration tests for plan generation API calls
  - Accessibility testing for WCAG AA compliance
  - Analytics event tracking verification
