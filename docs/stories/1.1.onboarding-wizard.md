6. Step 5: Collect user's age for personalized recommendations
7. Step 6: Collect weekly availability (days and preferred time slots)
8. Step 7: GDPR consent and privacy policy acceptance
9. Step 8: Summary and confirmation screen
10. Generate and save a 14-day training plan with `rookie_challenge=true` flag
11. Navigate to Today Dashboard upon completion
12. Track `onboard_complete` event with PostHog analytics including age and goalDist
13. Handle form validation and error states gracefully
14. Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance
15. Provide error recovery mechanisms for network and database issues

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project - no previous story context available.

### Data Models
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#3]
- **User Interface**: `{ id?: number; name?: string; goal: 'habit' | 'distance' | 'speed'; age?: number; experience?: string; ... }`
- **Plan Interface**: `{ id?: number; userId: number; rookie_challenge: boolean; ... }`
- **Workout Interface**: `{ id?: number; planId: number; week: number; ... }`
- Database persistence handled via Dexie.js schema in `lib/db.ts`

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#4]
- **Plan Generation API**: `app/api/generate-plan/route.ts` - Handles POST requests to generate a plan for a user
- **Error Response Format**: 
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Error message",
    "fallback": true,
    "retryAfter": 30000
  }
  ```

### Component Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- **Main Component**: `onboarding-screen.tsx` – 8-step wizard, goal selection, consent
- **UI Primitives**: Available in `components/ui/` – Card, Button, Badge, Dialog, etc. (Radix UI + Tailwind)
- **Navigation**: `bottom-navigation.tsx` – Tab bar navigation (for post-onboarding)
- **Error Handling**: `error-toast.tsx` – Toast notifications for errors
- **Network Status**: `NetworkStatusIndicator` – Shows connection status

### File Locations
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- Main onboarding component: `components/onboarding-screen.tsx`
- Plan generation logic: `lib/planGenerator.ts`
- Database models: `lib/db.ts`
- API route: `app/api/generate-plan/route.ts`
- Error handling hooks: `hooks/use-network-error-handling.ts`, `hooks/use-database-error-handling.ts`, `hooks/use-ai-service-error-handling.ts`

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs - following standard React testing practices with unit tests for components and integration tests for API calls.

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/prd.md#7]
- Mobile: React Native (Note: Architecture shows Next.js - needs clarification)
- Dark-first design approach
- Performance: App cold start < 1.5s
- Accessibility: WCAG AA compliance required
- Analytics: PostHog cloud integration

### PostHog Analytics Integration
[Source: docs/prd.md#10]
- Event: `onboard_complete`
- Required Properties: age, goalDist, rookieChallenge
- Trigger: Finish wizard

### Privacy & Compliance
[Source: docs/prd.md#5]
- GDPR consent required in onboarding flow
- Privacy compliance for health data

### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Network Errors**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff, offline mode support
- **Database Errors**: Health checks, data recovery mechanisms, fallback to local storage
- **AI Service Errors**: Fallback to guided form-based onboarding, service status monitoring
- **Validation Errors**: Real-time form validation with clear error messages
- **Session Recovery**: Resume incomplete onboarding sessions on app restart

### Troubleshooting Guide
- **Common Issues**:
  - Network connectivity problems: App shows offline indicator, retries automatically
  - Database corruption: Automatic health checks, data recovery options
  - AI service unavailable: Falls back to guided form-based onboarding
  - Form validation errors: Clear error messages with specific guidance
- **Debug Procedures**:
  - Check browser console for error logs
  - Verify network connectivity
  - Clear app storage if database issues persist
  - Check AI service status in settings

## Testing

## QA Results
## QA Results

### Review Date: יום חמישי, 17 ביולי 2025
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is generally good. The code is well-structured and follows a clear component-based approach. Error handling for plan generation is improved.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: V0/components/onboarding-screen.tsx
  - **Change**: Added import for `planAdjustmentService`.
  - **Why**: The service was used but not imported, leading to a runtime error.
  - **How**: Ensures the `planAdjustmentService` is correctly initialized and used.
- **File**: V0/lib/planGenerator.ts
  - **Change**: Modified `generateFallbackPlan` to accept `rookie_challenge` parameter.
  - **Why**: The `rookie_challenge` flag was not being passed to the fallback plan generation, leading to inconsistent plan types.
  - **How**: Ensures the fallback plan correctly reflects the rookie challenge.
- **File**: V0/components/onboarding-screen.tsx
  - **Change**: Added a new step (Step 5) to collect user's age. Updated `totalSteps` from 7 to 8. Adjusted `canProceed` logic and `renderStep` to accommodate the new step.
  - **Why**: The story required `age` to be tracked with the `onboard_complete` event, but it was not being collected.
  - **How**: Collects the user's age and integrates it into the onboarding flow and user data.
- **File**: V0/components/onboarding-screen.tsx
  - **Change**: Modified `trackEngagementEvent` call to include `age` and `goalDist` properties.
  - **Why**: The story's acceptance criteria required `age` and `goalDist` to be tracked with the `onboard_complete` event.
  - **How**: Ensures all required properties are sent to PostHog analytics.
- **File**: V0/components/onboarding-screen.test.tsx
  - **Change**: Updated test cases to include interaction with the new age input field and modified the `trackEngagementEvent` assertion to expect `age` and `goalDist`.
  - **Why**: To ensure the new age collection step is properly tested and the analytics event tracking is accurate.
  - **How**: Aligns the test with the updated component functionality and analytics requirements.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All original ACs are met, and new requirements for age collection and analytics properties are also met.)

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Refactored `onboarding-screen.tsx` to include age collection.
- [x] Ensured `planAdjustmentService` is correctly imported and used.
- [x] Updated `generateFallbackPlan` to handle `rookie_challenge` flag.
- [x] Verified `onboard_complete` event includes `age` and `goalDist`.

### Security Review
No new security concerns introduced. Data handling for age and health data is covered by existing consent mechanisms.

### Performance Considerations
The changes are minimal and should not impact performance significantly. The addition of one step to the onboarding flow is negligible.

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done
