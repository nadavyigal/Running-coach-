# Story 4.3: Positive Feedback & Success Toasts

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user who completes actions in the app,
**I want** to receive positive feedback (e.g., success toasts) for achievements and completed tasks,
**so that** I feel motivated and recognized for my progress.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Success toasts/notifications are shown for key actions (e.g., add run, complete plan session)
2. Feedback is visually distinct and accessible
3. Feedback is consistent across all main flows
4. No regression in error feedback
5. UI follows accessibility and dark-first design patterns

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3): Implement positive feedback toasts/notifications
  - [ ] Add success toast for run added, plan session completed, etc.
  - [ ] Ensure visual distinction and accessibility (ARIA, contrast)
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 4): Regression test error feedback
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 5): Review UI for accessibility and dark mode compliance

## Dev Notes
- Use existing toast system in `hooks/use-toast.ts` [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#Custom Hooks]
- UI: follow PRD ยง8.3 recommendations for feedback and accessibility
- Test in all main flows: add run, complete session, etc.

## Testing
- Place tests in `V0/components/ui/toast.test.tsx` and integration tests for main flows
- Use Jest/RTL for UI, Vitest for logic
- Test cases: success toast shown, accessibility, regression on error feedback
