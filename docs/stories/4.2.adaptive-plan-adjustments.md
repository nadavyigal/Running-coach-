# Story 4.2: Adaptive Plan Adjustments

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user whose schedule or performance may change,
**I want** my running plan to adapt automatically after each run and nightly,
**so that** my plan stays realistic and motivating.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Plan is recomputed nightly based on user activity
2. Plan is updated immediately after a run is recorded
3. User receives feedback when plan is adjusted
4. Plan adjustments are persistent and visible in the UI
5. All changes are tracked in analytics
6. No regression in plan generation or user data

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 4): Implement plan recompute logic
  - [ ] Add nightly job or trigger for plan recompute
  - [ ] Trigger plan update after run is saved
  - [ ] Persist updated plan in local DB
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 3): Provide user feedback (toast/notification) on plan adjustment
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 5): Instrument analytics for plan adjustments
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 6): Regression test plan generation and user data

## Dev Notes
- Use `lib/planGenerator.ts` for plan logic [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#Logic & Data Models]
- Plan data model: see `lib/db.ts` [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#Data Models & Persistence]
- Analytics: follow PRD ยง10 (plan_session_completed, etc.)
- UI feedback: use toast system [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#Custom Hooks]

## Testing
- Place tests in `V0/lib/planGenerator.test.ts` and integration tests for plan update flows
- Use Vitest for logic, Jest/RTL for UI
- Test cases: nightly recompute, post-run update, persistence, analytics event
