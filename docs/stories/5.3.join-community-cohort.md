# Story 5.3: Join Community Cohort

## Status
done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to join a small cohort via invite code,
**so that** I can see group progress and foster a sense of community.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can join a small cohort via invite code and see group progress

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement backend API for cohort management. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Define API endpoints for joining a cohort (e.g., `/api/cohort/join`).
  - [ ] Implement logic to validate invite codes and associate users with cohorts.
  - [ ] Implement data models for Cohorts and Cohort Members.
- [ ] Develop UI for joining a cohort. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create a modal or screen for entering an invite code.
  - [ ] Integrate Radix UI primitives (e.g., `components/ui/Input`, `components/ui/Button`).
  - [ ] Ensure UI follows dark-first, mobile-first design patterns.
- [ ] Integrate cohort joining functionality into existing screens. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add an entry point (e.g., button or menu item) in `profile-screen.tsx` or `today-screen.tsx`.
  - [ ] Connect UI to the cohort joining modal/screen.
- [ ] Implement client-side logic for joining a cohort. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Handle invite code input and submission.
  - [ ] Call the new API route to join the cohort.
  - [ ] Provide feedback to the user (success/failure).
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests.
  - [ ] Test the new API routes for cohort joining and data integrity.
  - [ ] Test the UI for invite code input and submission.
  - [ ] Verify integration points in `profile-screen.tsx` or `today-screen.tsx`.
- [ ] Ensure privacy and data exposure are handled correctly.
  - [ ] Confirm only anonymized group progress is visible.
  - [ ] Implement clear consent for sharing data within a cohort.

## Dev Notes
- **Data Models:**
  - New `Cohort` interface (e.g., `id`, `name`, `inviteCode`, `members`).
  - New `CohortMember` interface (e.g., `userId`, `cohortId`, `joinDate`).
  - `User` interface in `lib/db.ts` will need to be updated to include `cohortId` if a user can only be in one cohort. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#3. Logic & Data Models]
- **API Specifications:**
  - New API route `app/api/cohort/join/route.ts` will be required to handle POST requests for joining a cohort. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#4. API Routes]
- **Component Specifications:**
  - `profile-screen.tsx` or `today-screen.tsx` will need modifications to include a way to join a cohort. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#2. Screens & UI Components]
  - `components/ui/Input` for invite code entry. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#2. Screens & UI Components]
  - `components/ui/Button` for submission. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#2. Screens & UI Components]
  - `components/ui/Dialog` (or similar) for the join cohort modal. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#2. Screens & UI Components]
- **File Locations:**
  - New API route: `V0/app/api/cohort/join/route.ts`
  - New UI component: `V0/components/join-cohort-modal.tsx`
  - Modifications to: `V0/components/profile-screen.tsx`, `V0/components/today-screen.tsx`
  - Updates to `V0/lib/db.ts` for new data models.
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Existing profile, badge, and run summary screens load without breaking. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md#Compatibility Requirements]
  - Sharing features tested for privacy and correct data exposure. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md#Definition of Done]
  - UI changes follow dark-first, mobile-first design patterns. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md#Compatibility Requirements]
  - Performance impact is minimal on dashboard/profile load time. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md#Compatibility Requirements]
