## Technical Requirements

### Test Infrastructure Architecture
```typescript
// Analytics Mock Configuration
vi.mock("@/lib/analytics", () => ({
  trackAnalyticsEvent: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  trackOnboardingChatMessage: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  trackConversationPhase: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  trackAIGuidanceUsage: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  trackOnboardingCompletion: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  trackError: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  // ... all other analytics exports
}));

// Error Handling Mock Configuration
vi.mock("@/lib/errorHandling", () => ({
  analyzeError: vi.fn().mockReturnValue({
    type: 'network',
    severity: 'medium',
    userMessage: 'Network error occurred'
  }),
  isNetworkErrorClient: vi.fn().mockReturnValue(true),
  showError: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  // ... all other error handling exports
}));

// Database Mock Configuration
vi.mock("@/lib/db", () => ({
  dbUtils: {
    getCurrentUser: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
      id: 1,
      onboardingComplete: true,
      // ... other user properties
    }),
    createUser: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(1),
    createPlan: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: 1 }),
    // ... all other database utilities
  }
}));
```

### Test Performance Optimization
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts optimizations
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: ['./vitest.setup.ts'],
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
      exclude: [
        'node_modules/',
        '**/*.d.ts',
        '**/*.config.*',
        '**/test-utils/**'
      ]
    },
    pool: 'forks',
    poolOptions: {
      forks: {
        singleFork: true
      }
    },
    maxConcurrency: 1,
    testTimeout: 10000
  }
});
```

### Error Boundary Testing
```typescript
// Error boundary test utilities
export const createErrorBoundaryTest = (Component: React.ComponentType) => {
  return render(
    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Error occurred</div>}>
      <Component />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
};

export const simulateError = (component: HTMLElement, error: Error) => {
  const errorEvent = new ErrorEvent('error', { error });
  component.dispatchEvent(errorEvent);
};
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: July 24, 2025
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Status: NOT READY FOR QA REVIEW**

The story is currently in "Ready for Development" status, but based on my analysis of the current test infrastructure state, significant work remains before this can be considered for QA review.

**Current Test State:**
- **60 failing test files** (far from the target of 0)
- **23 failed tests** (target is 0 failed tests)
- Test execution taking >4s (target is <2s)
- Multiple critical issues identified:
  1. URL parsing errors in API mocking (`Invalid URL: /api/recovery/recommendations...`)
  2. Missing analytics function mocks
  3. Incomplete error handling test configuration
  4. Component tests failing due to missing dependencies

### Critical Issues Identified

**1. API Mocking Infrastructure**
- API calls are failing due to malformed URLs in test environment
- Recovery API endpoints not properly mocked
- Fetch requests failing with URL parsing errors

**2. Analytics Mocking Status**
- ✅ Basic analytics mocking is implemented in `vitest.setup.ts`
- ❌ Missing some required analytics exports in mocks
- ❌ Inconsistent mock configuration across test files

**3. Error Handling Test Infrastructure**
- ✅ Basic error handling mocks are in place
- ❌ Error boundary testing utilities not implemented
- ❌ Network error simulation needs enhancement

**4. Test Performance Issues**
- Current test execution: 4.29s (target: <2s)
- Memory usage appears high (up to 138MB heap)
- Test isolation issues causing cascading failures

### Immediate Action Items Required

**Before QA Review:**
1. **Fix API URL Mocking** - Resolve fetch URL parsing errors
2. **Complete Test Fixes** - Address all 60 failing test files
3. **Implement Missing Mocks** - Ensure 100% mock coverage
4. **Optimize Test Performance** - Achieve <2s execution time
5. **Add Error Boundary Testing** - Implement comprehensive error scenario testing

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ⚠️ Partial - Test code follows standards where implemented
- Project Structure: ✅ Test files properly organized
- Testing Strategy: ❌ Strategy partially implemented, needs completion
- All ACs Met: ❌ Major acceptance criteria still pending

### Recommendations for Development Team

**High Priority (Block Release):**
1. Focus on the URL parsing errors first - these are preventing basic test execution
2. Implement proper API base URL mocking in test environment
3. Complete the analytics mock exports to match actual implementation
4. Fix component test dependencies and imports

**Medium Priority:**
1. Optimize test performance through better test isolation
2. Implement test data factories for consistent test data
3. Add comprehensive error boundary testing utilities

**Low Priority:**
1. Enhanced test reporting and coverage visualization
2. Performance regression test automation

### Final Status
**❌ NOT APPROVED - Significant Development Work Required**

**Estimated Remaining Work:** 6-8 story points
**Blocking Issues:** 60 failing tests, API mocking infrastructure incomplete
**Next Steps:** Development team should address failing tests systematically, starting with URL/API mocking issues

**NOTE:** This story should remain in "In Progress" status until all acceptance criteria are met and tests are passing consistently.
