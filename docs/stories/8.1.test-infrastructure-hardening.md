## Technical Requirements

### Test Infrastructure Architecture
```typescript
// Analytics Mock Configuration
vi.mock("@/lib/analytics", () => ({
  trackAnalyticsEvent: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  trackOnboardingChatMessage: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  trackConversationPhase: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  trackAIGuidanceUsage: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  trackOnboardingCompletion: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  trackError: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  // ... all other analytics exports
}));

// Error Handling Mock Configuration
vi.mock("@/lib/errorHandling", () => ({
  analyzeError: vi.fn().mockReturnValue({
    type: 'network',
    severity: 'medium',
    userMessage: 'Network error occurred'
  }),
  isNetworkErrorClient: vi.fn().mockReturnValue(true),
  showError: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  // ... all other error handling exports
}));

// Database Mock Configuration
vi.mock("@/lib/db", () => ({
  dbUtils: {
    getCurrentUser: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
      id: 1,
      onboardingComplete: true,
      // ... other user properties
    }),
    createUser: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(1),
    createPlan: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: 1 }),
    // ... all other database utilities
  }
}));
```

### Test Performance Optimization
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts optimizations
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: ['./vitest.setup.ts'],
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
      exclude: [
        'node_modules/',
        '**/*.d.ts',
        '**/*.config.*',
        '**/test-utils/**'
      ]
    },
    pool: 'forks',
    poolOptions: {
      forks: {
        singleFork: true
      }
    },
    maxConcurrency: 1,
    testTimeout: 10000
  }
});
```

### Error Boundary Testing
```typescript
// Error boundary test utilities
export const createErrorBoundaryTest = (Component: React.ComponentType) => {
  return render(
    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Error occurred</div>}>
      <Component />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
};

export const simulateError = (component: HTMLElement, error: Error) => {
  const errorEvent = new ErrorEvent('error', { error });
  component.dispatchEvent(errorEvent);
};
```
