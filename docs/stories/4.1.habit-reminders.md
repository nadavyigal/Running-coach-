# Story 4.1: Habit Reminders

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user who wants to build a running habit,
**I want** to receive push reminders at my chosen cue time (with snooze/disable options),
**so that** I am nudged to stay consistent and not miss planned runs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can set a daily reminder time for habit cue
2. App sends a push notification at the set time
3. User can snooze or disable reminders
4. Reminders are persistent across app restarts
5. Reminder events are tracked in analytics
6. UI follows accessibility and dark-first design patterns

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4): Implement reminder scheduling logic
  - [ ] Add reminder time setting to user profile/settings
  - [ ] Integrate push notification API for scheduled reminders
  - [ ] Add snooze/disable controls to reminder UI
  - [ ] Persist reminder settings in local DB
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 5): Instrument analytics for reminder events
  - [ ] Track reminder set, triggered, snoozed, disabled
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 6): Ensure UI/UX meets accessibility and dark mode standards
  - [ ] Add ARIA labels, test contrast, and mobile responsiveness

## Dev Notes
- Reminder logic should be implemented in a service or hook, e.g., `lib/reminderService.ts` [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#Logic & Data Models]
- Use Dexie.js for persisting reminder settings [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#Data Models & Persistence]
- Integrate with existing notification and toast system [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#Custom Hooks]
- Analytics events should follow PRD ยง10 (reminder_clicked, etc.)
- UI must follow accessibility recommendations from PRD ยง8.3

## Testing
- Place tests in `V0/lib/reminderService.test.ts` and relevant component test files
- Use Vitest for logic, Jest/RTL for UI
- Test cases: reminder set, triggered, snoozed, disabled, persistence, analytics event
