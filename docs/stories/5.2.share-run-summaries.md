## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to share my completed run/session summaries with friends,
**so that** I can celebrate my progress and encourage others.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Enable sharing of completed run/session summaries with friends

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement new API route for generating shareable run summary content/links. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Define API endpoint (e.g., `/api/share-run`).
  - [ ] Implement logic to generate unique shareable links for run summaries.
  - [ ] Ensure proper authentication and authorization for sharing.
- [ ] Develop a new UI component for the share modal (reusing if possible from 5.1). (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Design modal with social media sharing buttons (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Copy Link).
  - [ ] Integrate Radix UI primitives (e.g., `components/ui/Dialog`, `components/ui/Button`).
  - [ ] Ensure UI follows dark-first, mobile-first design patterns.
- [ ] Integrate sharing functionality into existing screens. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add a "Share" button to `workout-details-modal.tsx` or `workout-breakdown-modal.tsx`.
  - [ ] Connect UI buttons to the new share modal.
- [ ] Implement client-side logic to trigger sharing. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Handle button clicks to open the share modal.
  - [ ] Call the new API route to get shareable links.
  - [ ] Use browser's Web Share API or copy link to clipboard.
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests.
  - [ ] Test the new API route for correct link generation and security.
  - [ ] Test the share modal UI and functionality.
  - [ ] Verify integration points in run summary modals.
- [ ] Ensure privacy and data exposure are handled correctly.
  - [ ] Confirm only intended data is shared.
  - [ ] Implement explicit user consent for sharing.

## Dev Notes
- **Data Models:**
  - `Run` interface in `lib/db.ts` (for run details). [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#3. Logic & Data Models]
  - `Workout` interface in `lib/db.ts` (for workout details associated with runs). [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#3. Logic & Data Models]
- **API Specifications:**
  - New API route `app/api/share-run/route.ts` will be required to handle POST requests for generating shareable run summary content. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#4. API Routes]
- **Component Specifications:**
  - `workout-details-modal.tsx` or `workout-breakdown-modal.tsx` will need modifications to include a share button. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#2. Screens & UI Components]
  - `components/ui/Button` will be used for share buttons. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#2. Screens & UI Components]
  - `components/ui/Dialog` (or similar) will be used for the share modal. [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#2. Screens & UI Components]
- **File Locations:**
  - New API route: `V0/app/api/share-run/route.ts`
  - New UI component: `V0/components/share-run-modal.tsx` (or reuse `share-badge-modal.tsx` with modifications)
  - Modifications to: `V0/components/workout-details-modal.tsx`, `V0/components/workout-breakdown-modal.tsx`
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Existing profile, badge, and run summary screens load without breaking. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md#Compatibility Requirements]
  - Sharing features tested for privacy and correct data exposure. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md#Definition of Done]
  - UI changes follow dark-first, mobile-first design patterns. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md#Compatibility Requirements]
  - Performance impact is minimal on dashboard/profile load time. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md#Compatibility Requirements]
