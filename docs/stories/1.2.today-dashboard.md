# Story 1.2: Today Dashboard + Initial Plan Generation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** novice runner who has completed onboarding,
**I want** to see today's workout session from my generated plan, my progress, and quick action buttons on the main dashboard,
**so that** I can easily understand what I need to do today based on my personalized 14-day running plan and track my running habit progress.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Dashboard Display
1. Display today's scheduled workout or rest day status clearly
2. Show a calendar strip with current week and highlight today
3. Display workout card with session details (distance, duration, type)
4. Provide "Record Run" and "Add Activity" CTAs prominently
5. Show progress indicators for current week and overall plan
6. Include quick access to AI Coach chat
7. Handle empty states gracefully (no plan, completed workout)
8. Support pull-to-refresh for plan updates
9. Navigate to Record Screen when "Record Run" is tapped
10. Navigate to Chat Screen when coach button is tapped
11. Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance

### Initial Plan Generation (Missing from Epic 1.2)
12. Generate personalized 14-day running plan upon onboarding completion
13. Flag user as part of 'rookie_challenge' program
14. Use OpenAI API for intelligent plan generation based on user profile
15. Fallback to local plan generation if API fails
16. Create plan and workout entries in database using planGenerator.ts
17. Handle different user experience levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
18. Respect user's preferred days per week and time preferences
19. Generate appropriate workout types (easy, tempo, intervals, long, rest)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 (Onboarding Wizard) established the foundation with user profile creation, plan generation with `rookie_challenge=true`, and navigation patterns. The onboarding saves user data to Dexie.js and generates a 14-day training plan.

### Data Models
[Source: V0/lib/db.ts]
- **User Interface**: `{ id?: number; name?: string; goal: 'habit' | 'distance' | 'speed'; experience: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'; preferredTimes: string[]; daysPerWeek: number; consents: {...}; onboardingComplete: boolean; rpe?: number; ... }`
- **Plan Interface**: `{ id?: number; userId: number; title: string; description?: string; startDate: Date; endDate: Date; totalWeeks: number; isActive: boolean; ... }`
- **Workout Interface**: `{ id?: number; planId: number; week: number; day: string; type: 'easy' | 'tempo' | 'intervals' | 'long' | 'time-trial' | 'hill' | 'rest'; distance: number; duration?: number; notes?: string; completed: boolean; scheduledDate: Date; ... }`
- **GeneratePlanOptions Interface**: `{ user: User; startDate?: Date; planType?: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'; targetDistance?: '5k' | '10k' | 'half-marathon' | 'marathon'; rookie_challenge?: boolean }`
- Database persistence handled via Dexie.js schema in `lib/db.ts`

### Plan Generation Specifications
[Source: V0/lib/planGenerator.ts]
- **generatePlan(options)**: Main function that calls OpenAI API via `/api/generate-plan` route
- **generateFallbackPlan(user, startDate)**: Fallback function for local plan generation when API fails
- **Plan Generation Flow**: API call → Database creation → Workout scheduling → Return plan and workouts
- **Rookie Challenge**: Flag `rookie_challenge: true` creates 14-day beginner-friendly plan
- **Error Handling**: API failures trigger fallback to local generation with basic workout patterns
- **Workout Notes**: Automatic generation of helpful notes for different workout types

### Component Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- **Main Component**: `today-screen.tsx` – Today dashboard, calendar strip, workout card, quick actions
- **UI Primitives**: Available in `components/ui/` – Card, Button, Badge, Dialog, etc. (Radix UI + Tailwind)
- **Navigation**: `bottom-navigation.tsx` – Tab bar navigation for screen switching
- **Modals**: Various modal components available for additional interactions

### File Locations
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- Main dashboard component: `components/today-screen.tsx`
- Plan generation logic: `lib/planGenerator.ts`
- Database utilities: `lib/db.ts` (dbUtils functions)
- Plan generation API: `app/api/generate-plan/route.ts`
- Utility functions: `lib/utils.ts`
- Custom hooks: `hooks/use-toast.ts`, `hooks/use-mobile.tsx`

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#4]
- **Plan Generation API**: `app/api/generate-plan/route.ts` – Handles POST requests to generate a plan for a user
- **Chat API**: `app/api/chat/route.ts` – Handles chat requests to OpenAI GPT-4o
- Plan data is retrieved from local Dexie.js database after generation
- Future adaptive plan updates may require additional API integration

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/prd.md#7, docs/prd.md#8.2]
- Mobile: React Native architecture (Note: Current V0 shows Next.js - needs clarification)
- Performance: App cold start < 1.5s
- Dark-first design approach
- Accessibility: WCAG AA compliance required

### Testing Requirements
- Test file location: Follow standard React testing patterns (likely `__tests__` or `.test.tsx` files)
- Testing frameworks: Standard React testing library (based on Next.js setup)
- Specific requirements for this story:
  - Unit tests for dashboard component rendering
  - Integration tests for data fetching from Dexie.js
  - Accessibility testing for WCAG AA compliance
  - Navigation flow testing

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: Follow standard React testing patterns (`components/today-screen.test.tsx`)
- Testing frameworks: Vitest with React Testing Library (established in Story 1.1)
- Test coverage requirements:
  - Component rendering with different data states (empty, with workout, rest day)
  - User interactions (button clicks, navigation)
  - Data fetching and error handling
  - Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
