# Story 1.4: AI Coach-Guided Onboarding with Goal Setting

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** novice runner starting my running journey,
**I want** to engage in a conversational AI coach-guided onboarding that helps me discover and articulate meaningful, achievable running goals,
**so that** I can receive a personalized training plan tailored to my unique motivations, circumstances, and capabilities rather than choosing from generic categories.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Replace static onboarding form with interactive AI coach conversation interface
2. Implement progressive conversation phases: motivation discovery, experience assessment, goal co-creation, and plan preview
3. Create adaptive questioning system that responds to user input with follow-up questions
4. Develop SMART goal creation logic that transforms user motivations into specific, measurable objectives
5. Implement coaching personality detection based on user responses (supportive, challenging, analytical, encouraging)
6. Extend User database model to include motivations, barriers, coaching style, and onboarding session data
7. Create fallback mechanism to existing onboarding flow if AI is unavailable
8. Add conversation state management with save/resume capability
9. Implement progress visualization showing conversation phase completion
10. Integrate with existing plan generation system to create personalized training plans
11. Add analytics tracking for conversation effectiveness and goal achievement correlation
12. Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance for conversational interface
13. Handle conversation length limits and provide "quick start" option for impatient users
14. Create goal validation logic with safety guardrails based on user experience level
15. Allow easy goal modification post-onboarding

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 (Onboarding Wizard) established the foundation with user profile creation and plan generation. Story 1.2 (Today Dashboard) integrated plan generation into the onboarding flow. Story 1.3 (Record Run) completed the core user journey. The AI Guided Onboarding builds upon this foundation by replacing the static form with an intelligent conversational experience.

### Data Models
[Source: V0/lib/db.ts]
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Extend existing User interface with new fields:
  ```typescript
  interface EnhancedUser extends User {
    motivations: string[];
    barriers: string[];
    coachingStyle: 'supportive' | 'challenging' | 'analytical' | 'encouraging';
    onboardingSession: OnboardingSession;
  }
  
  interface OnboardingSession {
    conversationId: string;
    goalDiscoveryPhase: 'motivation' | 'assessment' | 'creation' | 'refinement' | 'complete';
    discoveredGoals: SmartGoal[];
    coachingStyle: CoachingStyle;
    conversationHistory: ConversationMessage[];
  }
  
  interface SmartGoal {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    type: 'primary' | 'supporting' | 'health';
    specific: string;
    measurable: string;
    achievable: string;
    relevant: string;
    timeBound: string;
    targetDate: Date;
  }
  ```

### API Specifications
[Source: V0/app/api/chat/route.ts]
- **Extended Chat API**: Enhance existing `/api/chat` route to handle onboarding-specific conversations
