# Story 2.2: AI Coach Chat

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** novice runner who wants guidance and motivation,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.1 (Today Dashboard) is complete and includes an "AI Coach Chat" button that should navigate to this chat interface. The today screen provides the entry point to the chat functionality.

### Data Models
[Source: V0/lib/db.ts]
- **User Interface**: `{ id?: number; name?: string; goal: 'habit' | 'distance' | 'speed'; experience: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'; preferredTimes: string[]; daysPerWeek: number; consents: {...}; onboardingComplete: boolean; ... }`
- **Run Interface**: `{ id?: number; workoutId: number; userId: number; startTime: Date; endTime: Date; distance: number; duration: number; pace: number; route?: any; notes?: string; ... }`
- **New ChatMessage Interface needed**: `{ id?: number; userId: number; role: 'user' | 'assistant'; content: string; timestamp: Date; tokenCount?: number; ... }`

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#4]
- **Chat API**: `app/api/chat/route.ts` – Handles chat requests to OpenAI GPT-4o
- **Requirements**: GPT-4o integration with user context
- **Performance**: ≤1.5s p95 response time
- **Budget**: $50/mo token budget for <5k MAU

### Component Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- **Main Component**: `chat-screen.tsx` – AI coach chat, suggested questions, thread UI
- **Navigation**: `bottom-navigation.tsx` – Tab bar navigation
- **UI Primitives**: Available in `components/ui/` – Card, Button, Badge, Dialog, Input, etc. (Radix UI + Tailwind)

### File Locations
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- Main component: `components/chat-screen.tsx`
- API endpoint: `app/api/chat/route.ts`
- Database utilities: `lib/db.ts` (dbUtils functions)
- Navigation: `components/bottom-navigation.tsx`
- UI components: `components/ui/` directory

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/prd.md#7, Architecture - run smart - mvp.txt]
- Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS application
- Dark-first design approach
- Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Mobile-focused responsive design
- Performance: App cold start < 1.5s
- LLM: OpenAI GPT-4o, token budget of $50/mo (<5k MAU)
- Chat response: ≤1.5s p95 latency
- Privacy: Last 3 runs + profile as context only

### Context Building Strategy
[Source: docs/prd.md#8.1]
- Include user profile (goals, experience level, preferences)
- Include last 3 completed runs (distance, pace, notes, RPE if available)
- Format context for optimal LLM consumption
- Implement privacy-conscious data selection

### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: Architecture - run smart - mvp.txt#7]
- Graceful degradation if OpenAI timeout
- Handle API failures with appropriate user feedback
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Show loading states during response generation

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs - implementing standard React component testing with focus on:
- Chat message rendering and interaction
- API integration and error handling
- Context building and data privacy
- Performance and response time testing
- Token usage monitoring
