## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md] The application is a Next.js 14 React application with Dexie.js local storage, using Radix UI components and Tailwind CSS. Key components include screen components (today-screen.tsx, plan-screen.tsx, etc.) and API routes in app/api/.

### QA Assessment Summary (Critical Issues)
Based on comprehensive QA review by Quinn (Senior Developer QA), Epic 8 has **NOT PASSED** Definition of Done requirements:

**Test Infrastructure Crisis:**
- 477 failing tests out of 668 total tests (71% failure rate vs. target 100% pass)
- 51 failing test files out of 59 total files  
- Test execution time: 73.61s (vs. target <2s)
- Critical API mocking infrastructure broken with URL parsing errors

**Build System Failures:**
- No CI/CD pipeline configured despite stories marked "done"
- No quality gates blocking deployments on test failures  
- TypeScript strict mode not enabled
- Multiple linting errors present

**Security Vulnerabilities:**
- No security scanning implemented
- No security headers configured
- No input validation framework
- Stories 8.3 and 8.5 marked "done" but completely unimplemented

**Epic Status:** Stories marked as "done" without actual implementation - major process failure

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**Test Infrastructure [Source: CLAUDE.md]:**
- Main application directory: V0/
- Test framework: Vitest with jsdom environment
- Mock setup in vitest.setup.ts includes analytics mocking
- Test files use .test.tsx extension with @testing-library/react
- Database mocking with fake-indexeddb

**Build Configuration [Source: package.json analysis]:**
- npm run dev - development server
- npm run build - production build
- npm run lint - ESLint checking
- npm run test - Vitest test execution

**Error Handling Architecture [Source: V0/lib/errorHandling.ts]:**
- Comprehensive error classes (ValidationError, NetworkError, etc.)
- Client-side error analysis with analyzeError function
- Error boundaries in components/error-boundaries.tsx
- Network status monitoring and offline storage

### Testing Standards
**Test Requirements:**
- All tests must use fake-indexeddb for database mocking
- Mock external services including analytics and error handling
- Use beforeEach to reset test state
- Test both success and error cases
- Verify data persistence and retrieval
- Target: <2s execution time for unit tests

**File Locations:**
- Tests co-located with components (.test.tsx files)
- Test setup: vitest.setup.ts  
- Test config: vitest.config.ts
- Mock configurations in setup file

**Critical Test Fixes Needed:**
1. Fix URL parsing in API mocking (Invalid URL: /api/recovery/recommendations...)
2. Complete analytics mock exports in vitest.setup.ts
3. Resolve component dependency issues in tests
4. Optimize test performance (currently 4x slower than target)
