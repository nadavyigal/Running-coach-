# Bug Story: Onboarding Cannot Be Completed – App boots to Today screen

**Epic:** 1 - User Onboarding & Core Experience  
**Story ID:** BUG-001  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimate:** 5 story points  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Type:** Bug Fix  
**Sprint:** Current  

## Bug Description

**Issue:** Wizard appears, but Finish button never saves; app immediately shows Today page with no plan.

**Current Behavior:**
- Onboarding wizard displays correctly with all 5 steps
- User can navigate through all wizard steps
- Finish button appears and is clickable
- Clicking Finish button does not persist user data or training plan
- App immediately redirects to Today screen
- Today screen shows no training plan or user data
- User appears to be in a "logged out" state despite completing onboarding

**Expected Behavior:**
- Completing wizard (all 5 steps) writes user + plan to DB
- App navigates to Today page with plan visible
- User data persists across app sessions
- Training plan is properly initialized and displayed

## User Story

**As a** new user completing onboarding,  
**I want** my profile and training plan to be saved when I finish the wizard,  
**so that** I can start using the app with my personalized training plan.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: User Data Persistence
- [ ] User profile data is saved to database during onboarding completion
- [ ] All wizard form fields are properly validated before saving
- [ ] User authentication state is properly established
- [ ] User session persists after onboarding completion
- [ ] User can access their profile data in subsequent app sessions

### AC2: Training Plan Creation
- [ ] Training plan is generated based on onboarding responses
- [ ] Plan is saved to database with proper user association
- [ ] Plan includes initial workouts and goals
- [ ] Plan follows the selected training approach (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- [ ] Plan respects user's availability and preferences

### AC3: Database Integration
- [ ] User table receives complete user record
- [ ] Training plan table receives initial plan data
- [ ] User-plan relationship is properly established
- [ ] Database transactions are atomic (all-or-nothing)
- [ ] Error handling prevents partial data saves

### AC4: Navigation & State Management
- [ ] App navigates to Today screen after successful onboarding
- [ ] Today screen displays user's training plan
- [ ] User authentication state is properly maintained
- [ ] No "logged out" state after onboarding completion
- [ ] App remembers user session across restarts

### AC5: Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] Clear error messages if onboarding save fails
- [ ] User can retry onboarding completion if it fails
- [ ] No data corruption if save process is interrupted
- [ ] Graceful handling of network connectivity issues
- [ ] Proper validation prevents invalid data saves

### AC6: Data Validation
- [ ] All required onboarding fields are validated
- [ ] Training plan generation validates user inputs
- [ ] Database constraints are respected
- [ ] No duplicate user records are created
- [ ] Data integrity is maintained throughout the process

## Technical Requirements

### Database Operations
```typescript
interface OnboardingSaveRequest {
  user: {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    experience: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
    goals: string[];
    availability: {
      daysPerWeek: number;
      minutesPerSession: number;
    };
    preferences: {
      trainingType: string[];
      equipment: string[];
    };
  };
  trainingPlan: {
    approach: string;
    initialWorkouts: Workout[];
    goals: Goal[];
    schedule: WeeklySchedule;
  };
}

interface OnboardingSaveResponse {
  success: boolean;
  userId?: number;
  planId?: number;
  error?: string;
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/onboarding/complete` - Save onboarding data and create training plan
- `GET /api/users/{userId}/plan` - Retrieve user's training plan
- `POST /api/auth/establish-session` - Establish user session after onboarding

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Ensure proper foreign key relationships
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user_plan 
FOREIGN KEY (currentPlanId) REFERENCES training_plans(id);

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_users_session ON users(sessionToken);
CREATE INDEX idx_plans_user ON training_plans(userId);
```

## UI/UX Requirements

### Onboarding Flow
1. **Form Validation**
   - Real-time validation of all required fields
   - Clear error messages for invalid inputs
   - Disable Finish button until all required fields are valid

2. **Save Process**

   - Progress indicator for multi-step save process
   - Success confirmation before navigation

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Clear error messages if save fails
   - Retry button for failed saves
   - Option to go back and modify data

### Today Screen Integration
1. **Plan Display**
   - Show user's training plan prominently
   - Display next scheduled workout
   - Show progress toward goals

2. **User State**
   - Display user name and profile
   - Show authentication status
   - Provide access to user settings

### Debugging Checklist

#### Console Logging Implementation
```typescript
// In onboarding-screen.tsx handleFinish()
const handleFinish = async () => {
  console.log('=== ONBOARDING FINISH START ===');
  console.log('Form data:', formData);
  console.log('Validation state:', validationErrors);
  
  try {
    console.log('Calling generate-plan API...');
    const planResponse = await fetch('/api/generate-plan', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(formData)
    });
    console.log('Plan API response:', planResponse.status, await planResponse.json());
    
    console.log('Calling users API...');
    const userResponse = await fetch('/api/users', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(userData)
    });
    console.log('User API response:', userResponse.status, await userResponse.json());
    
    console.log('Navigation to Today screen...');
    router.push('/today');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Onboarding finish error:', error);
  }
};
```

#### Database Inspection Queries
```javascript
// Check users table
const users = await db.users.toArray();
console.log('Users in DB:', users);

// Check training plans table
const plans = await db.trainingPlans.toArray();
console.log('Training plans in DB:', plans);

// Check relationships
const userWithPlan = await db.users.where('id').equals(userId).first();
console.log('User with plan:', userWithPlan);
```

#### API Endpoint Verification
```typescript
// In /api/generate-plan/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  console.log('=== GENERATE PLAN API CALL ===');
  console.log('Request body:', await request.json());
  
  try {
    // Implementation
    console.log('Plan generated successfully');
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true, plan });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Generate plan error:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: error.message }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```
