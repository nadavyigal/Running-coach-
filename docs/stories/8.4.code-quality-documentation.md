## Technical Requirements

### API Documentation Standards
```typescript
/**
 * Generates a personalized training plan for a user based on their goals and experience.
 * 
 * @param user - The user object containing profile information
 * @param options - Configuration options for plan generation
 * @param options.rookieChallenge - Whether to include the 21-day rookie challenge
 * @param options.adaptive - Whether to use adaptive planning based on user feedback
 * @param options.goals - Specific goals to target in the plan
 * 
 * @returns Promise<PlanGenerationResult> - The generated training plan with metadata
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const plan = await generatePlan({
 *   user: { id: 1, experience: 'beginner', goal: 'habit' },
 *   options: { rookieChallenge: true, adaptive: true }
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * @throws {ValidationError} When user data is invalid
 * @throws {PlanGenerationError} When plan generation fails
 * 
 * @since 1.0.0
 * @deprecated Use generateAdaptivePlan instead for new implementations
 */
export async function generatePlan(
  user: User,
  options: PlanGenerationOptions = {}
): Promise<PlanGenerationResult> {
  // Implementation...
}
```

### Code Comment Standards
```typescript
// Business Logic: Calculate heart rate zones based on user's max HR
// This uses the Karvonen formula which is more accurate than percentage-based zones
// Formula: Target HR = ((Max HR - Resting HR) Ã— Intensity) + Resting HR
const calculateHeartRateZones = (maxHR: number, restingHR: number): HeartRateZones => {
  const heartRateReserve = maxHR - restingHR;
  
  return {
    zone1: {
      name: 'Recovery',
      min: restingHR + (heartRateReserve * 0.5),
      max: restingHR + (heartRateReserve * 0.6),
      description: 'Easy pace for recovery and warm-up'
    },
    zone2: {
      name: 'Aerobic Base',
      min: restingHR + (heartRateReserve * 0.6),
      max: restingHR + (heartRateReserve * 0.7),
      description: 'Conversational pace for building endurance'
    },
    // ... other zones
  };
};

// Edge Case Handling: Handle network timeouts gracefully
// If the API call takes longer than 10 seconds, we show a user-friendly message
// and retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
const fetchUserData = async (userId: number, retryCount = 0): Promise<User> => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`, {
      signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10000) // 10 second timeout
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    if (retryCount < 3 && isRetryableError(error)) {
      const delay = Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      return fetchUserData(userId, retryCount + 1);
    }
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### Type Safety Configuration
```typescript
// tsconfig.json strict mode configuration
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "allowUnusedLabels": false,
    "allowUnreachableCode": false
  }
}

// Type definitions with proper documentation
interface TrainingPlan {
  /** Unique identifier for the plan */
  id: number;
  
  /** The user this plan was generated for */
  userId: number;
  
  /** Plan generation timestamp */
  createdAt: Date;
  
  /** Whether this plan includes the rookie challenge */
  rookieChallenge: boolean;
  
  /** Array of workouts in the plan */
  workouts: Workout[];
  
  /** Plan metadata and statistics */
  metadata: PlanMetadata;
}

// Generic type with constraints
interface DataProcessor<T extends Record<string, any>> {
  /** Process the input data and return transformed result */
  process(data: T): Promise<ProcessedData<T>>;
  
  /** Validate the input data before processing */
  validate(data: T): ValidationResult;
  
  /** Get processing statistics */
  getStats(): ProcessingStats;
}
```

### Code Pattern Standards
```typescript
// React Component Pattern
interface ComponentProps {
  /** User data to display */
  user: User;
  
  /** Callback when user data changes */
  onUserChange: (user: User) => void;
  
  /** Whether the component is in loading state */
  isLoading?: boolean;
  
  /** CSS class name for styling */
  className?: string;
}

/**
 * UserProfile component displays user information and allows editing.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Displays user avatar, name, and basic info
 * - Allows inline editing of user details
 * - Handles loading and error states
 * - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
 */
export const UserProfile: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({
  user,
  onUserChange,
  isLoading = false,
  className
}) => {
  // State management pattern
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  const [editedUser, setEditedUser] = useState(user);
  
  // Effect pattern for data synchronization
  useEffect(() => {
    setEditedUser(user);
  }, [user]);
  
  // Event handler pattern
  const handleSave = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
      await updateUser(editedUser);
      onUserChange(editedUser);
      setIsEditing(false);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to update user:', error);
      // Show error toast
    }
  }, [editedUser, onUserChange]);
  
  // Render pattern with conditional rendering
  if (isLoading) {
    return <UserProfileSkeleton />;
  }
  
  return (
    <div className={cn('user-profile', className)}>
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```
