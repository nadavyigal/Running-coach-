# Story 3.2: Render Streak Progress Indicator

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user who wants to build consistent running habits,
**I want** to see my current streak displayed prominently on the today dashboard with visual feedback,
**so that** I can quickly track my progress and stay motivated by seeing my daily activity streak count.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Display ðŸ”¥ icon + current streak count prominently on /today dashboard
2. Show visual feedback when streak increases (animation/highlight effect)
3. Handle zero streak state gracefully with encouraging message
4. Integrate with existing today-screen.tsx without breaking current functionality
5. Follow existing dark-first design patterns and UI component standards
6. Ensure real-time updates when user completes daily activities
7. Display streak data persists after app refresh using data from Story 3.1

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 (Persist Streak Counter) implemented comprehensive streak tracking infrastructure:
- Extended User interface with streak fields (currentStreak, longestStreak, lastActivityDate, streakLastUpdated)
- Added automatic streak updates on activity completion (createRun and markWorkoutCompleted)
- Database schema migration ensures backward compatibility with existing user data
- Streak calculation functions available in dbUtils: calculateCurrentStreak, updateUserStreak, getStreakStats

### Data Models
[Source: V0/lib/db.ts - Story 3.1 implementation]
- **User Interface**: Contains streak fields ready for display
  ```ts
  currentStreak?: number;           // Current consecutive days
  longestStreak?: number;          // All-time best streak
  lastActivityDate?: Date;         // Last day with recorded activity
  streakLastUpdated?: Date;        // Timestamp of last streak calculation
  ```
- **Database Utilities**: Existing functions in dbUtils class
  - `getCurrentUser(): Promise<User | undefined>` - Get current user with streak data
  - `calculateCurrentStreak(userId: number): Promise<number>` - Recalculate streak
  - `updateUserStreak(userId: number): Promise<void>` - Update streak after activity

### Component Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- **Today Screen**: `today-screen.tsx` - Main dashboard with calendar strip, workout card, quick actions
- **UI Components**: Use existing `components/ui/` - Card, Button, Badge, etc. (Radix UI + Tailwind)
- **Design System**: Follow existing dark-first design patterns and Tailwind color palette
- **Icons**: Use Lucide React icons (existing imports include Sun, Clock, CalendarPlus, etc.)

### File Locations
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#2]
- Main component integration: `V0/components/today-screen.tsx`
- Optional new component: `V0/components/streak-indicator.tsx` (if complex enough to separate)
- Database utilities: Use existing `V0/lib/db.ts` functions
- Type definitions: Extend existing interfaces if needed

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#1]
- Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript application
- Existing UI built with Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
- Must maintain current today-screen functionality without breaking changes
- Use existing useEffect patterns and state management approaches
- Follow existing loading state patterns (isLoadingWorkout example)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: Story 3.1 testing patterns]
- Unit testing using existing Vitest configuration
- Component testing for streak display with various states
- Integration testing with today-screen functionality
- Test zero-state, normal streak counts, and error scenarios
- Verify no regression in existing dashboard features

### Integration Points
[Source: V0/components/today-screen.tsx analysis]
- Today screen already loads user data with `dbUtils.getCurrentUser()`
- Existing useEffect pattern for loading workouts can be extended for streak data
- Current loading states and error handling patterns should be followed
- Component uses existing toast system for user feedback

### Design Pattern References
[Source: V0/components/today-screen.tsx structure]
- Card-based layout with CardHeader and CardContent
- Badge components for status indicators
- Icon usage with Lucide React (existing pattern: Sun, Clock, etc.)
- State management with useState and useEffect hooks
- Error handling with try/catch and toast notifications

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: Story 3.1 testing implementation]
- **Test file location**: `V0/components/today-screen.test.tsx` (extend existing) or create `V0/components/streak-indicator.test.tsx`
- **Test frameworks**: Vitest with React Testing Library (existing setup)
- **Testing patterns**: 
  - Component rendering with different streak values
  - User interaction testing for animations/effects
  - Integration testing with database utilities
  - Error state and loading state testing
- **Specific requirements**: 
  - Test zero-state streak display
  - Test various streak count scenarios (1, 5, 30+ days)
  - Test real-time updates when streak changes
  - Verify accessibility of animations and visual effects
