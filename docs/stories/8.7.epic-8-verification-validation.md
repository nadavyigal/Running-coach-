## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Epic 8 has implemented comprehensive quality assurance measures across Stories 8.1-8.5
- Need to validate all implementations systematically before production deployment
- Verification system must be non-intrusive and not affect existing functionality

### Data Models
- **VerificationResult**: Stores validation results with timestamps, status, metrics, and details
- **VerificationRule**: Defines validation rules and thresholds for different quality aspects
- **VerificationReport**: Aggregates results into comprehensive reports with recommendations
- **VerificationConfig**: Stores configuration for verification systems and thresholds

### API Specifications
- **POST /api/verification/run**: Execute full verification suite
- **GET /api/verification/status**: Get current verification status
- **GET /api/verification/reports**: Retrieve verification reports
- **POST /api/verification/config**: Update verification configuration
- **GET /api/verification/metrics**: Get verification metrics and trends

### Component Specifications
- **VerificationDashboard**: Main dashboard showing verification status and results
- **VerificationCard**: Individual verification result display with status indicators
- **VerificationChart**: Visual representation of verification metrics over time
- **VerificationConfig**: Configuration interface for verification rules and thresholds
- **VerificationReport**: Detailed report view with recommendations and action items

### File Locations
- **V0/lib/verification/**: Core verification engine and utilities
- **V0/lib/verification/engine.ts**: Main verification engine
- **V0/lib/verification/validators/**: Individual validation systems
- **V0/lib/verification/reporting.ts**: Report generation and export
- **V0/app/api/verification/**: API endpoints for verification system
- **V0/app/verification/**: UI components for verification dashboard
- **V0/components/verification/**: Reusable verification UI components

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all verification validators and engines
- Integration tests for verification workflows
- End-to-end tests for complete verification process
- Performance tests to ensure verification doesn't impact application
- Security tests for verification system access controls

### Technical Constraints
- Must not impact application performance during verification
- Verification system should be configurable and extensible
- All verification results must be stored and retrievable
- System should support both automated and manual verification triggers
- Must integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline

### Performance Considerations
- Verification execution should be optimized for speed
- Large verification reports should be paginated
- Real-time status updates should use efficient polling or WebSocket
- Verification data should be archived after retention period

### Security Requirements
- Verification system access should be role-based
- Sensitive verification data should be encrypted
- Verification logs should not expose sensitive application data
- API endpoints should be properly authenticated and authorized

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: V0/__tests__/verification/ for verification system tests
- **Framework**: Vitest for unit and integration tests
- **Coverage**: >90% coverage required for verification engine
- **Performance**: Verification tests should complete within 30 seconds
- **Security**: All verification tests should validate security measures

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each verification validator
- Integration tests for verification workflows
- End-to-end tests for complete verification process
- Performance benchmarks for verification execution
- Security tests for verification system access
