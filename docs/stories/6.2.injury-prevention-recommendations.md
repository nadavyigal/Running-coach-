# Story 6.2: Injury Prevention Recommendations

## Status
done

## Story
**As a** health-conscious runner,
**I want** to receive personalized injury prevention recommendations,
**so that** I can run safely and avoid common running injuries.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Analyze running patterns to identify injury risk factors (training load increases, frequency patterns, pace consistency)
2. Provide personalized stretching and strengthening routines based on running history and detected risks
3. Suggest optimal rest days based on training load and recovery metrics
4. Alert users when training intensity increases too rapidly (>10% weekly increase rule)
5. Offer alternative low-impact activities during high-risk periods
6. Display injury risk score (0-100) with clear explanations of contributing factors
7. Integrate with existing workout planning to automatically adjust plans when risks are detected
8. Provide educational content about common running injuries and prevention strategies

## Acceptance Tests

### Risk Assessment Functionality
```gherkin
Given a user has completed runs for 4+ weeks
When they view the injury prevention dashboard
Then they should see:
  - Current injury risk score (0-100)
  - Risk factor breakdown (training load, pace variance, frequency)
  - Risk trend over the past 4 weeks
  - Color-coded risk level indicator
```

### Recommendation Engine
```gherkin
Given a user has a medium-high injury risk score (>60)
When they view injury prevention recommendations
Then they should see:
  - 3-5 personalized stretching exercises
  - Recommended rest days for the next week
  - Alternative low-impact activity suggestions
  - Educational content relevant to their risk factors
```

### Plan Integration
```gherkin
Given a user's injury risk increases to high (>80)
When they view their training plan
Then they should see:
  - Notification about elevated risk
  - Suggested plan modifications (reduced intensity/volume)
  - Option to accept or customize the modifications
  - Clear explanation of why changes are recommended
```
