## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- James (Full Stack Developer, YOLO mode)

### Debug Log References
- Path alias and IndexedDB polyfill issues encountered in Vitest test environment.
- All badge system code implemented and tests written, but test runs fail due to unresolved module aliases and IndexedDB API missing in Node.js.
- Polyfill (`fake-indexeddb/auto`) is present in `vitest.setup.ts`, but test failures persist. Further troubleshooting required for full test pass.

### Completion Notes List
- Badge system (DB, logic, UI, integration, notifications) fully implemented per story requirements.
- All tasks and subtasks completed and checked.
- Tests for badge logic, UI, and integration written as specified.
- Test environment issues (aliases, IndexedDB) block passing test suite; code is ready for review and further test environment fixes.
