# Story: Onboarding Reliability & Analytics Upgrade

## Status
ready for development

## Story
**As a** product team,
**I want** the onboarding flow to be highly reliable with comprehensive analytics tracking,
**so that** we can ensure smooth user progression and gather actionable insights for continuous improvement.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Foundation & Error Handling (Phase 1)
- [ ] **State Management Enhancement**
  - Reset onboarding state on any error (clear `onboardingInProgress` / `currentUserId`)
  - Add error boundary component for onboarding screens
  - Implement automatic state cleanup on app restart
  - Add state validation before proceeding to next step
- [ ] **Progress Indicator Fix**
  - Progress indicator shows 8 steps instead of 7
  - Each step number corresponds to actual onboarding step
  - Visual feedback for current step and completed steps
  - Accessibility labels for screen readers
- [ ] **Error Handling & Toast Messages**
  - Toast messages for all error states (network, database, AI service)
  - Retry mechanisms for failed operations
  - Graceful degradation when services unavailable
  - Clear error messages with actionable guidance

### AC2: Data Persistence & Chat State (Phase 2)
- [ ] **Chat Session Persistence**
  - Save/load conversation history from IndexedDB
  - Resume chat from last conversation state
  - Handle conversation state conflicts
  - Implement conversation cleanup for old sessions
- [ ] **Database Schema Extension**
  - Add `OnboardingSession` table to Dexie schema
  - Implement conversation message storage
  - Add conversation metadata (phase, progress, etc.)
  - Migration script for existing users

### AC3: Analytics & Monitoring (Phase 3)
- [ ] **Missing Analytics Events**
  - `goal_discovered` event with goal details
  - `onboarding_completed` with completion method (chat vs form)
  - Conversation phase tracking events
  - Error tracking for onboarding failures
  - Performance metrics for onboarding flow
- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard**
  - Completion rate tracking
  - Drop-off point analysis
  - Error rate monitoring
  - A/B test framework for onboarding variations

### AC4: Testing & Documentation (Phase 4)
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**
  - Unit tests for state management functions
  - Integration tests for AI chat flow
  - E2E tests for error scenarios and recovery
  - Performance tests for onboarding flow
  - Test coverage >90% for onboarding components
- [ ] **Documentation Updates**
  - Update `docs/stories/1.1.onboarding-wizard.md` with new flow
  - Update `docs/stories/1.4.ai-guided-onboarding.md` with implementation details
  - Create troubleshooting guide for onboarding issues
  - Update API documentation for new endpoints

### AC5: Success Metrics
- [ ] **Technical Metrics**
  - Onboarding completion rate >85%
  - Error rate <5%
  - Average onboarding time <3 minutes
  - Test coverage >90%
- [ ] **User Experience Metrics**

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Plan Summary
This story implements a comprehensive reliability and analytics upgrade for the onboarding flow based on the Analyst's detailed implementation plan. The work is divided into 4 phases with clear deliverables and success metrics.

### Risk Mitigation
- **State Corruption Risk**: Implement state validation and automatic cleanup
- **AI Service Dependency**: Implement fallback to form-based onboarding
- **Database Migration Risk**: Implement migration scripts with rollback capability
- **Performance Impact**: Implement lazy loading and optimize database queries
- **User Experience Complexity**: A/B test different flows and gather user feedback

### Dependencies
- Existing onboarding infrastructure (`V0/lib/onboardingManager.ts`)
- Current database schema (`V0/lib/db.ts`)
- Analytics system (`V0/lib/analytics.ts`)
