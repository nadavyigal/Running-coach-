## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Building on Story 4.1 habit formation analytics
- Following established notification component patterns
- Maintaining existing notification functionality

### Data Models
- **Engagement Optimization Schema:**
  ```typescript
  interface EngagementOptimization {
    userId: string;
    notificationPreferences: NotificationPreferences;
    engagementPatterns: EngagementPattern[];
    optimalTiming: OptimalTiming;
    motivationalTriggers: MotivationalTrigger[];
  }
  
  interface NotificationPreferences {
    frequency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    timing: 'morning' | 'afternoon' | 'evening';
    types: NotificationType[];
    quietHours: { start: string; end: string };
  }
  
  interface OptimalTiming {
    bestTime: string;
    timezone: string;
    lastEngagement: Date;
    engagementScore: number;
  }
  ```

- **Enhanced Notification Model:**
  ```typescript
  interface Notification {
    // ... existing fields
    engagementType: 'motivational' | 'reminder' | 'achievement' | 'milestone';
    personalization: NotificationPersonalization;
    engagementScore: number;
  }
  ```

### Component Specifications
- **Engagement Optimization Component:**
  - Location: `components/engagement-optimization.tsx`
  - Props: `{ user: User, onPreferencesChange: (preferences: NotificationPreferences) => void }`
  - Uses Radix UI components: Switch, Select, Slider, Card
  - Follows existing notification component styling patterns

- **Integration with Notification System:**
  - Enhance existing notification system with engagement optimization
  - Maintain existing notification functionality
  - Preserve existing notification UI and interactions

### File Locations
- New component: `components/engagement-optimization.tsx`
- Updated component: `components/notification-system.tsx`
- Engagement service: `lib/engagement-optimization.ts`
- Database schema: `lib/db.ts` (add engagement optimization fields)
- Tests: `__tests__/engagement-optimization.test.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for engagement optimization component
- Integration tests for engagement optimization service
- Mock tests for engagement optimization calculations
- Performance tests for notification delivery

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing notification functionality
- Follow existing notification component patterns
- Ensure notification delivery doesn't impact performance
- Handle notification service failures gracefully

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Create Engagement Optimization Component (AC: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8)
1. Create `components/engagement-optimization.tsx` with preference controls
2. Implement smart notification system with personalized timing
3. Add motivational reminders based on user patterns
4. Implement notification preferences and customization options
5. Follow existing notification component UI patterns

### Task 2: Enhance Engagement Service (AC: 3, 4, 6, 13, 14)
1. Create `lib/engagement-optimization.ts` service
2. Implement achievement celebrations and milestone notifications
3. Add adaptive notification frequency based on user engagement
4. Implement engagement tracking and analytics
5. Add motivational trigger system

### Task 3: Integrate with Notification System (AC: 7, 9, 10)
1. Enhance existing notification system with engagement optimization
2. Integrate engagement optimization with notification database
3. Update notification database schema with engagement fields
4. Maintain existing notification functionality

### Task 4: Database Schema Updates (AC: 9)
1. Add engagement optimization fields to existing Notification model
2. Create migration script for existing notification data
3. Update database utilities to handle engagement optimization
4. Add engagement optimization data validation

### Task 5: Testing and Documentation (AC: 11, 12, 13, 14)
1. Write unit tests for engagement optimization component
2. Create integration tests for engagement optimization service
3. Test engagement optimization accuracy
4. Verify notification performance
5. Update component documentation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Engagement optimization component created and functional
- [ ] Engagement service enhanced with smart notification system
- [ ] Integration with existing notification system complete
- [ ] Database schema updated with engagement optimization fields
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, performance)
- [ ] Engagement notifications are helpful and not intrusive
- [ ] Notification performance is fast and responsive
- [ ] No regression in existing notification functionality
