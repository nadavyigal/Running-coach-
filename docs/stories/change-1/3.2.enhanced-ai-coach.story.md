  interface AICoachResponse {
    response: string;
    suggestedQuestions: string[];
    followUpActions: FollowUpAction[];
    confidence: number;
    contextUsed: string[];
  }
  ```

- **Performance Trend Analysis:**
  ```typescript
  interface PerformanceTrend {
    metric: 'distance' | 'pace' | 'duration' | 'frequency';
    trend: 'improving' | 'declining' | 'stable';
    value: number;
    period: 'week' | 'month' | 'quarter';
  }
  ```

- Tests: `__tests__/enhanced-ai-coach.test.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for enhanced AI coach component
- Integration tests for AI context integration
- Mock tests for OpenAI API responses with context
- Performance tests for AI response generation

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing AI chat functionality
- Follow existing OpenAI SDK patterns
- Ensure AI response times meet performance requirements
- Handle AI service failures gracefully

1. Create `components/enhanced-ai-coach.tsx` with context integration
2. Implement recent run data integration in responses
3. Add performance trend analysis display
4. Implement personalized coaching style adaptation
5. Follow existing ChatScreen UI patterns

### Task 2: Enhance AI Service with Context (AC: 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14)
1. Create `lib/enhanced-ai-coach.ts` service
2. Implement context-aware response generation
3. Add performance trend analysis for coaching
4. Implement proactive coaching suggestions
5. Add goal-specific coaching modules

### Task 3: Integrate with Chat System (AC: 7, 9, 10)
1. Enhance existing ChatScreen with context-aware responses
2. Integrate AI coach context with chat database
3. Update chat database schema with context fields
4. Maintain existing chat functionality

### Task 4: Database Schema Updates (AC: 9)

2. Create migration script for existing chat data
3. Update database utilities to handle AI coach context
4. Add AI coach context data validation

### Task 5: Testing and Documentation (AC: 11, 12, 13, 14)
1. Write unit tests for enhanced AI coach component
2. Create integration tests for AI context integration
3. Test AI response relevance and accuracy
4. Verify AI response performance
5. Update component documentation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Enhanced AI coach component created and functional
- [ ] AI service enhanced with context-aware responses
- [ ] Integration with existing chat system complete
- [ ] Database schema updated with AI coach context fields
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, performance)
- [ ] AI responses are relevant and helpful for coaching
- [ ] Error handling for AI failures implemented
- [ ] No regression in existing chat functionality
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Feature flag ready for deployment

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Enhanced AI context may impact response times
**Mitigation:** Optimized context processing with caching
**Rollback:** Feature flag to disable enhanced AI features, preserve existing chat functionality

## Notes

- This story enhances existing AI chat functionality without breaking current features
- AI coach context is additive to existing chat system
- Follows established OpenAI SDK patterns for consistency
- Requires careful testing of AI context integration and response accuracy
- Performance monitoring is critical for AI response times with context 

## QA Results

### Implementation Status: ✅ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

**Critical Findings:**
1. **Missing Component**: The specified `components/enhanced-ai-coach.tsx` component does not exist
2. **Missing Service**: The `lib/enhanced-ai-coach.ts` service was not implemented as specified
3. **No Database Schema Updates**: AI coach context fields were not added to chat database schema
4. **No Performance Trend Analysis**: Performance trend analysis functionality was not implemented

**What Was Actually Implemented:**
- ✅ **Adaptive Coaching Engine**: Comprehensive `lib/adaptiveCoachingEngine.ts` with personalized responses
- ✅ **Enhanced Chat Integration**: Chat API (`/api/chat/route.ts`) integrated with adaptive coaching
- ✅ **Context-Aware Responses**: User context integration with mood, environment, weather, schedule
- ✅ **Coaching Feedback System**: Feedback collection and processing (`/api/coaching/feedback/route.ts`)
- ✅ **Adaptive Recommendations**: Proactive coaching suggestions (`/api/coaching/adaptive-recommendations/route.ts`)
- ✅ **Personalized Prompts**: Dynamic prompt adaptation based on user profiles and patterns
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Component Architecture**: Implemented adaptive coaching engine instead of separate enhanced AI coach component
- **Performance Trends**: No performance trend analysis or visualization features
- **Database Schema**: No additional AI coach context fields in database
- **UI Integration**: Enhanced features integrated into existing chat rather than separate component

**Implementation Quality Assessment:**
- **Strengths**: 
  - Sophisticated adaptive coaching with user profile learning
  - Comprehensive context integration (mood, weather, schedule)
  - Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Feedback-driven improvement system
- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - Missing performance trend analysis visualization
  - No dedicated enhanced AI coach component
  - Limited performance trend data collection

**Recommendations:**
1. **High Priority**: Implement performance trend analysis and visualization
2. **Medium Priority**: Create dedicated enhanced AI coach component for better separation of concerns
3. **Medium Priority**: Add performance trend data collection to database schema
4. **Low Priority**: Add comprehensive testing for performance trend features

**Confidence Level: 85%** - The core functionality was implemented with a different architecture than specified, but the adaptive coaching features exceed the original requirements in sophistication.
