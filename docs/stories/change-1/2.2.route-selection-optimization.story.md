14. Route selection performance is fast and responsive

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Building on Story 2.1 GPS accuracy monitoring
- Following established RecordScreen and map component patterns
- Maintaining existing route selection functionality

### Data Models
- **Enhanced Route Model:**
  ```typescript
  interface Route {
    // ... existing fields
    safetyScore: number; // 0-100
    difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
    popularity: number;
    elevationGain: number;
    surfaceType: string[];
    wellLit: boolean;
    lowTraffic: boolean;
    scenicScore: number;
  }
  ```

- **Route Recommendation Schema:**
  ```typescript
  interface RouteRecommendation {
    routeId: string;
    name: string;
    distance: number;
    difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
    safetyScore: number;
    popularity: number;
    elevationGain: number;
    surfaceType: string[];
    matchScore: number; // How well it matches user preferences
  }
  ```

### Component Specifications
- **Route Selection Wizard Component:**
  - Location: `components/route-selection-wizard.tsx`
  - Props: `{ userExperience: string, onRouteSelected: (route: Route) => void }`
  - Uses Radix UI components: Dialog, Select, Slider, Card
  - Follows existing map component styling patterns

- **Integration with RecordScreen:**
  - Add route selection wizard to existing run tracking flow
  - Maintain existing route selection functionality
  - Preserve existing map and tracking UI

### File Locations
- New component: `components/route-selection-wizard.tsx`
- Updated component: `components/record-screen.tsx`
- Route service: `lib/route-recommendations.ts`
- Database schema: `lib/db.ts` (add route recommendation fields)
- Tests: `__tests__/route-selection-wizard.test.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for route selection wizard component
- Integration tests for route recommendation service
- Mock tests for route API responses
- Performance tests for route selection

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing route selection functionality
- Follow existing map component patterns
- Ensure route selection performance is fast
- Handle route service failures gracefully

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Create Route Selection Wizard Component (AC: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8)
1. Create `components/route-selection-wizard.tsx` with guided interface
2. Implement beginner-friendly route filter with safety scoring
3. Add route preview with elevation profile and difficulty indicators
4. Implement route selection wizard for guided experience
5. Follow existing map component UI patterns

### Task 2: Enhance Route Recommendation Service (AC: 3, 4, 5, 13, 14)
1. Create `lib/route-recommendations.ts` service
2. Implement route recommendations based on user experience
3. Add route safety and popularity scoring
4. Implement route matching algorithm
5. Add route preview and selection logic

### Task 3: Integrate with Run Tracking (AC: 4, 7, 9, 10)
1. Add route selection wizard to existing RecordScreen
2. Integrate route recommendations with run tracking flow
3. Update route database schema with recommendation fields
4. Maintain existing route selection functionality

### Task 4: Database Schema Updates (AC: 9)
1. Add route recommendation fields to existing Route model
2. Create migration script for existing route data
3. Update database utilities to handle route recommendations
4. Add route recommendation data validation

### Task 5: Testing and Documentation (AC: 11, 12, 13, 14)
1. Write unit tests for route selection wizard component
2. Create integration tests for route recommendation service
3. Test route recommendation accuracy
4. Verify route selection performance
5. Update component documentation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Route selection wizard component created and functional
- [ ] Route recommendation service enhanced with safety scoring
- [ ] Integration with existing run tracking complete
- [ ] Database schema updated with route recommendation fields
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, performance)
- [ ] Route recommendations are accurate and helpful
- [ ] Route selection performance is fast and responsive
- [ ] No regression in existing route functionality
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Feature flag ready for deployment

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Route recommendation service may impact performance
**Mitigation:** Optimized route recommendation algorithm with caching
**Rollback:** Feature flag to disable route selection wizard, preserve existing route selection

## Notes

- This story enhances existing route selection functionality without breaking current features
- Route recommendations are additive to existing route system
- Follows established map component patterns for consistency
- Requires careful testing of route recommendation accuracy and performance
- Route safety scoring should be based on real data and user feedback
