## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Building on Story 2.1 GPS accuracy monitoring
- Following established RecordScreen and map component patterns
- Maintaining existing route selection functionality

### Data Models
- **Enhanced Route Model:**
  ```typescript
  interface Route {
    // ... existing fields
    safetyScore: number; // 0-100
    difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
    popularity: number;
    elevationGain: number;
    surfaceType: string[];
    wellLit: boolean;
    lowTraffic: boolean;
    scenicScore: number;
  }
  ```

- **Route Recommendation Schema:**
  ```typescript
  interface RouteRecommendation {
    routeId: string;
    name: string;
    distance: number;
    difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
    safetyScore: number;
    popularity: number;
    elevationGain: number;
    surfaceType: string[];
    matchScore: number; // How well it matches user preferences
  }
  ```

### Component Specifications
- **Route Selection Wizard Component:**
  - Location: `components/route-selection-wizard.tsx`
  - Props: `{ userExperience: string, onRouteSelected: (route: Route) => void }`
  - Uses Radix UI components: Dialog, Select, Slider, Card
  - Follows existing map component styling patterns

- **Integration with RecordScreen:**
  - Add route selection wizard to existing run tracking flow
  - Maintain existing route selection functionality
  - Preserve existing map and tracking UI

### File Locations
- New component: `components/route-selection-wizard.tsx`
- Updated component: `components/record-screen.tsx`
- Route service: `lib/route-recommendations.ts`
- Database schema: `lib/db.ts` (add route recommendation fields)
- Tests: `__tests__/route-selection-wizard.test.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for route selection wizard component
- Integration tests for route recommendation service
- Mock tests for route API responses
- Performance tests for route selection

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing route selection functionality
- Follow existing map component patterns
- Ensure route selection performance is fast
- Handle route service failures gracefully
