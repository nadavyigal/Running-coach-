## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Building on Epic 2 GPS and route enhancements
- Following established PlanScreen component patterns
- Maintaining existing plan management functionality

### Data Models
- **Plan Complexity Engine Schema:**
  ```typescript
  interface PlanComplexityEngine {
    userExperience: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
    planLevel: 'basic' | 'standard' | 'advanced';
    adaptationFactors: AdaptationFactor[];
    complexityScore: number; // 0-100
  }
  
  interface AdaptationFactor {
    factor: 'performance' | 'feedback' | 'consistency' | 'goals';
    weight: number;
    currentValue: number;
    targetValue: number;
  }
  ```

- **Enhanced Plan Model:**
  ```typescript
  interface Plan {
    // ... existing fields
    complexityLevel: 'basic' | 'standard' | 'advanced';
    complexityScore: number;
    adaptationFactors: AdaptationFactor[];
    userFeedback: PlanFeedback[];
  }
  ```

### Component Specifications
- **Plan Complexity Indicator Component:**
  - Location: `components/plan-complexity-indicator.tsx`
  - Props: `{ plan: Plan, onComplexityChange: (complexity: PlanComplexityEngine) => void }`
  - Uses Radix UI components: Progress, Badge, Tooltip, Card
  - Follows existing PlanScreen styling patterns

- **Integration with PlanScreen:**
  - Add complexity indicators to existing plan display
  - Maintain existing plan management functionality
  - Preserve existing plan UI and interactions

### File Locations
- New component: `components/plan-complexity-indicator.tsx`
- Updated component: `components/plan-screen.tsx`
- Plan service: `lib/plan-complexity-engine.ts`
- Database schema: `lib/db.ts` (add plan complexity fields)
- Tests: `__tests__/plan-complexity-indicator.test.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for plan complexity indicator component
- Integration tests for plan complexity engine
- Mock tests for plan complexity calculations
- Performance tests for plan complexity updates

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing plan management functionality
- Follow existing PlanScreen component patterns
- Ensure plan complexity updates don't impact performance
- Handle plan complexity calculations gracefully

2. Implement experience-based difficulty adjustment display
3. Add performance-based plan modification indicators
4. Implement visual plan explanations with tooltips
5. Follow existing PlanScreen UI patterns

### Task 2: Enhance Plan Complexity Engine (AC: 4, 5, 6, 13, 14)
1. Create `lib/plan-complexity-engine.ts` service
2. Implement experience-based plan difficulty adjustment
3. Add performance-based plan modification logic
4. Implement progressive complexity scoring system
5. Add user feedback integration for plan adjustments

### Task 3: Integrate with Plan Management (AC: 7, 9, 10)
1. Add plan complexity indicator to existing PlanScreen
2. Integrate plan complexity engine with plan management flow
3. Update plan database schema with complexity fields
4. Maintain existing plan management functionality

### Task 4: Database Schema Updates (AC: 9)
1. Add plan complexity fields to existing Plan model
2. Create migration script for existing plan data
3. Update database utilities to handle plan complexity
4. Add plan complexity data validation

### Task 5: Testing and Documentation (AC: 11, 12, 13, 14)
1. Write unit tests for plan complexity indicator component
2. Create integration tests for plan complexity engine
3. Test plan complexity calculation accuracy
4. Verify plan complexity performance
5. Update component documentation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Plan complexity indicator component created and functional
- [ ] Plan complexity engine enhanced with difficulty adjustment
- [ ] Integration with existing plan management complete
- [ ] Database schema updated with plan complexity fields
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, performance)
- [ ] Plan complexity adjustments are accurate and helpful
- [ ] Plan complexity performance is fast and responsive
- [ ] No regression in existing plan functionality
