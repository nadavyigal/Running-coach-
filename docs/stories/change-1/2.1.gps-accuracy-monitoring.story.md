    satellitesVisible: number;
    locationQuality: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'fair' | 'poor';
    timestamp: Date;
    coordinates: {
      latitude: number;
      longitude: number;
    };
  }
  ```

- **Enhanced Run Tracking Model:**
  ```typescript
  interface RunSession {
    // ... existing fields
    gpsAccuracy: GPSAccuracyData[];
