## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Building on Epic 1 privacy and onboarding enhancements
- Following established RecordScreen component patterns
- Maintaining existing run tracking functionality

### Data Models
- **GPS Accuracy Data Schema:**
  ```typescript
  interface GPSAccuracyData {
    signalStrength: number; // 0-100
    accuracyRadius: number; // meters
    satellitesVisible: number;
    locationQuality: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'fair' | 'poor';
    timestamp: Date;
    coordinates: {
      latitude: number;
      longitude: number;
    };
  }
  ```

- **Enhanced Run Tracking Model:**
  ```typescript
  interface RunSession {
    // ... existing fields
    gpsAccuracy: GPSAccuracyData[];
    startAccuracy: GPSAccuracyData;
    endAccuracy: GPSAccuracyData;
  }
  ```

### Component Specifications
- **GPS Accuracy Indicator Component:**
  - Location: `components/gps-accuracy-indicator.tsx`
  - Props: `{ accuracy: GPSAccuracyData, onAccuracyChange: (accuracy: GPSAccuracyData) => void }`
  - Uses Radix UI components: Progress, Badge, Alert
  - Follows existing RecordScreen styling patterns

- **Integration with RecordScreen:**
  - Add GPS accuracy overlay to existing run tracking interface
  - Maintain existing run tracking functionality
  - Preserve existing map and tracking UI

### File Locations
- New component: `components/gps-accuracy-indicator.tsx`
- Updated component: `components/record-screen.tsx`
- GPS service: `lib/gps-monitoring.ts`
- Database schema: `lib/db.ts` (add GPS accuracy fields)
- Tests: `__tests__/gps-accuracy-indicator.test.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for GPS accuracy indicator component
- Integration tests for GPS monitoring service
- Mock tests for GPS API responses
- Performance tests for GPS accuracy updates

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing run tracking functionality
- Follow existing GPS/location service patterns
- Ensure GPS accuracy updates don't impact performance
- Handle GPS service failures gracefully
