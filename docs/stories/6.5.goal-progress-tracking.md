2. Track progress with visual indicators, charts, and milestone celebrations
3. Provide goal adjustment recommendations based on current progress and trends
4. Send motivational messages and progress updates at key intervals
5. Suggest intermediate milestones to maintain engagement and momentum
6. Support multiple concurrent goals with different priorities and timelines
7. Integrate with performance analytics to show correlation between training and progress
8. Enable goal sharing with community features for accountability and support

## Acceptance Tests

### SMART Goal Creation
```gherkin
Given a user wants to set a new running goal
When they use the goal creation interface
Then they should be able to:
  - Set specific target (e.g., "Run 5K in under 25 minutes")
  - Choose measurable metrics (time, distance, frequency)
  - Set achievable targets based on current fitness
  - Define relevance to their overall running objectives
  - Set time-bound deadline with milestone dates
```

### Progress Tracking
```gherkin
Given a user has an active goal to improve 5K time by 2 minutes in 12 weeks
When they complete runs and workouts
Then they should see:
  - Current progress percentage toward goal
  - Pace improvement trend over time
  - Projected completion date based on current trajectory
  - Specific metrics (current PR, target time, improvement needed)
```

### Milestone Celebrations
```gherkin
Given a user reaches 50% progress toward their goal
When they view the goal dashboard
Then they should see:
  - Celebration animation and congratulatory message
  - Achievement badge for reaching milestone
  - Updated timeline and remaining milestones
  - Encouragement and next steps guidance
```

### Goal Adjustment Recommendations
```gherkin
Given a user is progressing slower than expected toward their goal
When the system analyzes their progress at the 8-week mark
Then it should:
  - Suggest extending timeline by 4 weeks
  - Recommend modified training approach
  - Provide explanation for adjustment necessity
  - Offer alternative goal targets if appropriate
```

### Multiple Goal Management
```gherkin
Given a user has both a speed goal (5K PR) and distance goal (first 10K)
When they view their goal dashboard
Then they should see:
  - Clear priority indication (primary vs. secondary)
  - Training plan integration showing how each goal is addressed
  - Progress toward each goal with no conflicts
  - Recommendations for balancing goal focus
```

## Definition of Done

### Goal Progress Calculation Algorithm
```typescript
interface GoalProgress {
  goalId: number;
  currentValue: number;
  targetValue: number;
  baselineValue: number;
  progressPercentage: number;
  trajectory: 'on_track' | 'ahead' | 'behind' | 'at_risk';
  projectedCompletion: Date;
  nextMilestone?: Milestone;
}

class GoalProgressEngine {
  calculateProgress(goal: Goal, recentActivities: Activity[]): GoalProgress {
    const currentValue = this.getCurrentValue(goal, recentActivities);
    const progressPercentage = this.calculateProgressPercentage(
      goal.baselineValue,
      currentValue,
      goal.targetValue
    );
    
    const trajectory = this.analyzeTrajectory(goal, progressPercentage);
    const projectedCompletion = this.projectCompletionDate(goal, progressPercentage);
    
    return {
      goalId: goal.id,
      currentValue,
      targetValue: goal.targetValue,
      baselineValue: goal.baselineValue,
      progressPercentage,
      trajectory,
      projectedCompletion,
      nextMilestone: this.getNextMilestone(goal.id)
    };
  }

  private calculateProgressPercentage(
    baseline: number,
    current: number,
    target: number
  ): number {
    if (target === baseline) return 100; // Already at target
    
    const totalImprovement = Math.abs(target - baseline);
    const currentImprovement = Math.abs(current - baseline);
    
    return Math.min(100, (currentImprovement / totalImprovement) * 100);
  }

  private analyzeTrajectory(goal: Goal, currentProgress: number): string {
    const timeElapsed = this.getTimeElapsedPercentage(goal);
    const expectedProgress = timeElapsed;
    
    if (currentProgress >= expectedProgress * 1.1) return 'ahead';
    if (currentProgress <= expectedProgress * 0.7) return 'at_risk';
    if (currentProgress <= expectedProgress * 0.9) return 'behind';
    return 'on_track';
  }

  generateMilestones(goal: Goal): Milestone[] {
    const milestones: Milestone[] = [];
    const totalDuration = goal.deadline.getTime() - goal.startDate.getTime();
    const totalImprovement = goal.targetValue - goal.baselineValue;
    
    // Generate milestones at 25%, 50%, 75% completion
    [0.25, 0.5, 0.75].forEach((percentage, index) => {
      milestones.push({
        order: index + 1,
        targetDate: new Date(goal.startDate.getTime() + (totalDuration * percentage)),
        targetValue: goal.baselineValue + (totalImprovement * percentage),
        title: `${percentage * 100}% Progress Milestone`,
        description: `Reach ${this.formatValue(goal.baselineValue + (totalImprovement * percentage))} by this date`
      });
    });
    
    return milestones;
  }
