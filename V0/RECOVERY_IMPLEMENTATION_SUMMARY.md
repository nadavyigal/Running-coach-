## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Recovery Score Algorithm
The recovery score calculation considers:
- **Sleep Quality (30%)**: Duration, efficiency, deep sleep percentage
- **HRV Metrics (25%)**: Heart rate variability trends and absolute values
- **Resting Heart Rate (20%)**: Morning resting HR trends
- **Subjective Wellness (15%)**: Energy, mood, soreness, stress levels
- **Training Load Impact (10%)**: Recent workout intensity and volume

### Data Flow
1. **Data Collection**: Sleep, HRV, and subjective data via API endpoints
2. **Processing**: RecoveryEngine calculates scores and trends
3. **Storage**: Dexie.js IndexedDB for local persistence
4. **Display**: React components with real-time updates
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing app screens

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error boundaries in UI components
- Graceful degradation when data is unavailable
- User-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms
- API endpoint error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
