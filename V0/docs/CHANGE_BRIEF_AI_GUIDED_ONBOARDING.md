# Change Brief: AI Coach-Guided Onboarding with Goal Setting

## Executive Summary

**Proposal**: Transform the current static onboarding flow into an interactive, AI coach-guided conversation that assists users in setting personalized running goals based on their individual circumstances, motivations, and capabilities.

**Current State**: Static 8-step form-based onboarding
**Proposed State**: Dynamic AI coach conversation with intelligent goal setting assistance

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Onboarding Flow
1. **Welcome Screen** - Static introduction
2. **Goal Selection** - 3 predefined categories (habit/distance/speed)
3. **Experience Level** - Basic categorization (beginner/occasional/regular)
4. **RPE Assessment** - Optional fitness self-assessment
5. **Age Collection** - Simple number input
6. **Schedule Preferences** - Time slots and frequency
7. **Privacy Consents** - Legal requirements
8. **Summary & Confirmation** - Review and complete

### Current Limitations
- **Rigid Goal Categories**: Limited to 3 broad goal types
- **No Context Understanding**: Doesn't explore WHY users want to run
- **Missed Opportunities**: No exploration of barriers, motivations, or specific circumstances
- **Generic Output**: Same goal categories produce similar plans regardless of individual nuances
- **No Guidance**: Users make choices without expert input or consideration of realistic expectations

---

## Proposed Solution: AI Coach-Guided Onboarding

### Vision Statement
*"An empathetic AI running coach that guides users through a conversational goal-setting process, helping them discover and articulate meaningful, achievable running objectives tailored to their unique life circumstances."*

### Core Components

#### 1. **Conversational Interface**
- Replace static forms with dynamic chat interface
- Adaptive questioning based on user responses
- Natural language processing for nuanced understanding
- Real-time clarification and follow-up questions

#### 2. **Intelligent Goal Discovery**
Instead of choosing from 3 categories, users engage in guided exploration:
- **Motivation Exploration**: "What draws you to running?"
- **Lifestyle Assessment**: "Tell me about your current schedule and constraints"
- **Experience Mining**: "Have you tried running before? What worked/didn't work?"
- **Aspiration Mapping**: "If you could achieve anything with running, what would it be?"
- **Barrier Identification**: "What might make it challenging for you to stick with running?"

#### 3. **SMART Goal Co-Creation**
The AI coach helps users develop:
- **Specific**: Clear, well-defined objectives
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable success criteria  
- **Achievable**: Realistic based on their starting point
- **Relevant**: Aligned with their personal motivations
- **Time-bound**: Clear timelines and milestones

#### 4. **Personalized Coaching Tone**
Based on user responses, establish coaching style:
- **Supportive** for anxious beginners
- **Challenging** for competitive personalities
- **Analytical** for data-driven users
- **Encouraging** for those lacking confidence

## User Experience Design

### Conversation Flow Example

```
ðŸ¤– Coach: "Hi! I'm excited to help you start your running journey. Before we dive into creating a plan, I'd love to understand what brought you here today. What made you decide to start running?"

ðŸ‘¤ User: "I want to get healthier and maybe lose some weight"

ðŸ¤– Coach: "That's a great motivation! Health and wellness are fantastic reasons to start running. When you think about being healthier, what would that look like for you in 3-6 months? Are there specific changes you're hoping to see?"

ðŸ‘¤ User: "I'd like to have more energy and maybe run a 5K without stopping"

ðŸ¤– Coach: "I love that! Having more energy for daily life AND being able to complete a 5K - those are both achievable and meaningful goals. Let's explore this a bit more. Have you tried running before, or would this be your first time establishing a regular running routine?"

... [conversation continues, building towards SMART goals]

ðŸ¤– Coach: "Based on our conversation, I think we can create some really exciting goals for you:

**Primary Goal**: Complete a 5K run without walking by [3 months from now]
**Supporting Goal**: Run 3 times per week consistently for energy improvement
**Health Goal**: Track how your energy levels improve over the next 12 weeks

Does this feel exciting and achievable to you? Should we adjust anything?"
```

### Progressive Goal Refinement

#### Phase 1: Motivation Discovery (2-3 exchanges)
- Explore WHY they want to run
- Understand current lifestyle and constraints
- Identify personality indicators for coaching style

#### Phase 2: Experience Assessment (2-4 exchanges)  
- Previous running/fitness experience
- What worked/didn't work in the past
- Current physical activity level
- Time availability and schedule constraints

#### Phase 3: Goal Co-Creation (3-5 exchanges)
- Transform motivations into specific objectives
- Set realistic timelines based on experience
- Create accountability measures
- Identify potential obstacles and solutions

#### Phase 4: Plan Preview & Commitment (1-2 exchanges)
- Show preview of personalized training plan
- Confirm goal commitment and excitement level
- Establish coaching relationship and communication preferences

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option A: Hybrid Approach
**Description**: AI coach appears in specific steps of existing onboarding
**Pros**: Lower risk, easier implementation
**Cons**: Less transformative impact, fragmented experience

### Option B: Wizard-Style Guided Questions
**Description**: Dynamic questioning without full conversation
**Pros**: Middle ground between static and conversational
**Cons**: Still feels like a form, misses conversational benefits

### Option C: Post-Onboarding Goal Setting
**Description**: Complete standard onboarding, then AI goal session
**Pros**: Doesn't disrupt existing flow
**Cons**: Misses opportunity to tailor entire experience to discovered goals

**Selected Approach**: Full conversational onboarding for maximum personalization impact

## Conclusion

This change brief proposes a significant enhancement to the user onboarding experience that leverages existing technical infrastructure while providing transformative value. The AI coach-guided goal setting addresses key limitations in the current system and aligns with the application's vision of providing personalized, intelligent running coaching.

The phased implementation approach allows for incremental delivery and risk mitigation while building toward a more engaging and effective onboarding experience that should improve both user satisfaction and long-term goal achievement rates.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1 implementation to validate the core concept while building foundation for subsequent enhancements.
